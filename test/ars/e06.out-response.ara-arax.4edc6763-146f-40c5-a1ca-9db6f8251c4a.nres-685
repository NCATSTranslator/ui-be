Examples of antioxidants include   Beta-carotene   Lutein   Lycopene  Selenium  Vitamin A  Vitamin C  Vitamin E  Vegetables and fruits are rich sources of antioxidants. There is good evidence that eating a diet with lots of vegetables and fruits is healthy and lowers risks of certain diseases. But it isn't clear whether this is because of the antioxidants, something else in the foods, or other factors. High-dose supplements of antioxidants may be linked to health risks in some cases. For example, high doses of beta-carotene may increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers. High doses of vitamin E may increase risks of prostate cancer and one type of stroke. Antioxidant supplements may also interact with some medicines. To minimize risk, tell you of your health care providers about any antioxidants you use.

Candesartan may be used to treat hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic nephropathy. It may also be used as an alternative agent for the treatment of heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Candesartan","Parapres","candesartan cilexetil","Candesartan Cilexetil","candesartan","Atacand","Tcv 116","Candesartan cilexetil (JP18/USP)","Candesartan (USAN/INN)","CANDESARTAN","CANDESARTAN CILEXETIL","Candesartan cilexetil","Kenzen","Amias"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["MESH:C077793","PathWhiz.Compound:9260","CHEBI:3347","LOINC:LP171390-0","VANDF:4021148","NDDF:007275","HMDB:HMDB0249581","VANDF:4021151","UMLS:C1529675","KEGG.DRUG:D00522","UMLS:C0718711","DRUGBANK:DB00796","UMLS:C0527379","RXNORM:135481","HMDB:HMDB0014934","UMLS:C0174494","DRUGBANK:DB13919","DrugCentral:475","RXNORM:215458","MESH:C081643","UMLS:C4083053","ATC:C09CA06","KEGG.COMPOUND:C07468","UMLS:C0717550","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1014","KEGG.COMPOUND:C07709","NCIT:C65284","PDQ:CDR0000546971","KEGG.DRUG:D00626","NCIT:C28903","UMLS:C4310340","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1016","RXNORM:214354","CHEBI:3348"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:8360879","PMID:15646539","PMID:18788725","PMID:17870541","PMID:29329002","PMID:20426472","PMID:13678868","PMID:20843939","PMID:23118328","PMID:28666735"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1017":{"name":"TELMISARTAN","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1017","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1017","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A benzimidazole derivative and a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist with antihypertensive property.

Progesterone, converted from pregnenolone, also serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of gonadal steroid hormones and adrenal corticosteroids. Progesterone is a C-21 steroid hormone involved in the female menstrual cycle, pregnancy (supports gestation) and embryogenesis of humans and other species. Progesterone belongs to a class of hormones called progestagens, and is the major naturally occurring human progestagen. During implantation and gestation, progesterone appears to decrease the maternal immune response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy. Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine smooth muscle. The fetus metabolizes placental progesterone in the production of adrenal mineralo- and glucosteroids. A drop in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of labor. In addition progesterone inhibits lactation during pregnancy. The fall in progesterone levels following delivery is one of the triggers for milk production. Progesterone is found to be associated with pregnene hydroxylation deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["P4 [cytosol]","PROGESTERONE","P4 [nucleoplasm]","Progesterone, (9 beta,10 alpha)-Isomer","Agolutin","P4 [extracellular region]","Progesterone (JP18/USP/INN)","Progesterone","Luteohormone","Akrolutin","dacuronium","progesterone"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["LOINC:MTHU003615","MESH:D011374","ATC:G03DA04","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL103","UMLS:C4256087","REACT:R-ALL-193055","KEGG.DRUG:D00066","NCIT:C2297","PathWhiz.Compound:1216","CHEBI:17026","RXNORM:8727","UMLS:C0886987","UMLS:C0033308","UMLS:C4256086","DRUGBANK:DB00396","NDDF:001290","REACT:R-ALL-5618083","UMLS:C1515388","REACT:R-ALL-1449667","LOINC:LP14041-5","VANDF:4017453","MESH:C003549","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00410","HMDB:HMDB0001830","DrugCentral:2279","PSY:40820"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:8709117","PMID:11859003","PMID:27484514","PMID:24601604","PMID:25454267","PMID:11785684","PMID:3040999","PMID:21944856","PMID:25282654","PMID:29407958"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1044":{"name":"PHENYLACETIC ACID","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1044","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1044","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Phenyl acetate (or phenylacetate) is a carboxylic acid ester that has been found in the biofluids of patients with nephritis and/or hepatitis as well as patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of metabolism. Phenyl acetate has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821). Excess phenylalanine in the body can be disposed of through a transamination process leading to the production of phenylpyruvate. The phenylpyruvate can be further metabolized into a number of products. Decarboxylation of phenylpyruvate gives phenylacetate, while a reduction reaction gives phenyllactate. The phenylacetate can be further conjugated with glutamine to give phenylacetyl glutamine. All of these metabolites can be detected in serum and urine of PKU patients. Phenyl acetate is also produced endogenously as the metabolite of 2-Phenylethylamine, which is mainly metabolized by monoamine oxidase to form phenyl acetate. 2-phenylethylamine is an \"endogenous amphetamine\" which may modulate central adrenergic functions, and the urinary phenyl acetate levels have been postulated as a marker for depression.

is a chemical substance that is essential to all known forms of life. It appears colorless to the naked eye in small quantities, though it is actually slightly blue in color. It covers 71% of Earth's surface. Current estimates suggest that there are 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (330 million m3) of it available on Earth, and it exists in many forms. It appears mostly in the oceans (saltwater) and polar ice caps, but it is also present as clouds, rain water, rivers, freshwater aquifers, lakes, and sea ice. Water in these bodies perpetually moves through a cycle of evaporation, precipitation, and runoff to the sea. Clean water is essential to human life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply. From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life that set it apart from other substances. It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Water is thus essential and central to these metabolic processes. Water is also central to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO2 (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO2 in the process (cellular respiration). Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H+, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as hydroxide ion (OH-) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a pH (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. Acids have pH values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7. Stomach acid (HCl) is useful to digestion. However, its corrosive effect on the esophagus during reflux can temporarily be neutralized by ingestion of a base such as aluminum hydroxide to produce the neutral molecules water and the salt aluminum chloride. Human biochemistry that involves enzymes usually performs optimally around a biologically neutral pH of 7.4.

Niacinamide belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nicotinamides. These are heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing a pyridine ring substituted at position 3 by a carboxamide group. Its primary significance is in the prevention and/or cure of blacktongue and pellagra. The structure of nicotinamide consists of a pyridine ring to which a primary amide group is attached in the meta position. It is an amide of nicotinic acid. As an aromatic compound, it undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions and transformations of its two functional groups. Niacinamide and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate can be converted into nicotinic acid mononucleotide and phosphate by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. In humans, niacinamide is involved in the metabolic disorder called the nad+ signalling pathway (cancer). Niacinamide is an odorless tasting compound. Outside of the human body, niacinamide is found, on average, in the highest concentration within a few different foods, such as common sages, cow milk, and cocoa beans and in a lower concentration in common pea. Niacinamide has also been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as yardlong beans, roselles, apples, oyster mushrooms, and swiss chards. Niacinamide occurs in trace amounts mainly in meat, fish, nuts, and mushrooms, as well as to a lesser extent in some vegetables. It is commonly added to cereals and other foods. Many multivitamins contain 20–30 mg of vitamin B3 and it is also available in higher doses.

A large dietary intake of tyramine can cause an increase in systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg or more. Tyramine acts as a neurotransmitter via a G protein-coupled receptor with high affinity for tyramine called TA1. The TA1 receptor is found in the brain as well as peripheral tissues including the kidney. An indirect sympathomimetic, Tyramine can also serve as a substrate for adrenergic uptake systems and monoamine oxidase so it prolongs the actions of adrenergic transmitters. It also provokes transmitter release from adrenergic terminals.

It is an antitubercular agent often administered in association with isoniazid. The sodium salt of the drug is better tolerated than the free acid. [PubChem]There are two mechanisms responsible for aminosalicylic acid's bacteriostatic action against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Firstly, aminosalicylic acid inhibits folic acid synthesis (without potentiation with antifolic compounds). The binding of para-aminobenzoic acid to pteridine synthetase acts as the first step in folic acid synthesis. Aminosalicylic acid binds pteridine synthetase with greater affinity than para-aminobenzoic acid, effectively inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid. As bacteria are unable to use external sources of folic acid, cell growth and multiplication slows. Secondly, aminosalicylic acid may inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall component, mycobactin, thus reducing iron uptake by <i>M. tuberculosis</i>.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:NamedThing","biolink:Drug","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["aminosalicylic acid","AMINOSALICYLIC ACID","SODIUM AMINOSALICYLATE","ASAL [cytosol]","Aminosalicylic acid","4-aminosalicylate","Aminosalicylate sodium (USP)","Aminosalicylate sodium anhydrous","Aminosalicylic Acid","AMINOSALICYLATE POTASSIUM","Aminosalicylic acid (USP)","AMINOSALICYLATE SODIUM","4-aminosalicylic acid","4-Aminosalicylate","AMINOSALICYLATE CALCIUM"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["RXNORM:7833","ttd.target:Aminosalicylic_Acid","UMLS:C0030125","KEGG.DRUG:D00162","CHEBI:2661","DrugCentral:2050","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1200584","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2096646","REACT:R-ALL-174973","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1169","KEGG.DRUG:D00875","VANDF:4018852","HMDB:HMDB0014378","UMLS:C4256130","KEGG.COMPOUND:C02518","KEGG.COMPOUND:C08055","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2105983","NCIT:C47394","DRUGBANK:DB00233","ATC:J04AA01","NDDF:002845","CHEBI:27565","MESH:D010131","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1200966"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:25593095","PMID:12877578","PMID:15214773","PMID:14443158","PMID:7137163","PMID:15494824","PMID:22931300","PMID:15646539","PMID:28126437","PMID:5560983"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL118":{"name":"CELECOXIB","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL118","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL118","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Celecoxib (INN) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain, painful menstruation and menstrual symptoms, and to reduce numbers of colon and rectum polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.

GHB acts as a central nervous system (CNS) neuromodulator, mediating its effects through GABA and GHB-specific receptors, or by affecting dopamine transmission (PMID: 16620539). GHB occurs naturally in all mammals, but its function remains unknown. GHB is labeled as an illegal drug in most countries, but it also is used as a legal drug (Xyrem) in patients with narcolepsy. It is used illegally (under the street names juice, liquid ecstasy, or G) as an intoxicant for increasing athletic performance and as a date rape drug. In high doses, GHB inhibits the CNS, inducing sleep and inhibiting the respiratory drive. In lower doses, its euphoriant effect predominates (PMID: 17658710). When present in sufficiently high levels, 4-hydroxybutyric acid can act as an acidogen, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A neurotoxin is a compound that adversely affects neural cells and tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 4-hydroxybutyric acid are associated with two inborn errors of metabolism: glutaric aciduria II and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADH). SSADH deficiency leads to a 30-fold increase of GHB and a 2-4 fold increase of GABA in the brains of patients with SSADH deficiency as compared to normal brain concentrations of the compounds. As an acidogen, 4-hydroxybutyric acid is an organic acid, and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Particularly for SSADH deficiency, the most common features observed include developmental delay, hypotonia, and intellectual disability. Nearly half of patients exhibit ataxia, seizures, behaviour problems, and hyporeflexia. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. As a neurotoxin, GHB appears to affect both GABA (a neurotransmitter) signaling and glutamate signaling (another neurotransmitter). Glutamine metabolism may also play a role in the pathophysiology of excessive levels of GHB. High levels of GHB have been shown to depress both the NMDA and AMPA/kainite receptor-mediated functions and may also alter glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission as well. 4-Hydroxybutyric acid is a microbial metabolite found in Aeromonas, Escherichia and Pseudomonas (PMID: 19434404).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["sodium oxybate","gamma-hydroxybutyric acid","gamma hydroxybutyrate","Sodium oxybate","gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid","4-hydroxybutyric acid","Xyrem","4-hydroxybutyrate","4-Hydroxyacid","Gamma hydroxybutyrate","OXYBATE","Sodium oxybate (USAN)","4-Hydroxybutyric acid","Somsanit","4-Hydroxybutanoic Acid","SODIUM OXYBATE","4-Hydroxybutanoic acid","HBUT [mitochondrial matrix]","Sodium Oxybate"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PathWhiz.Compound:561","RXNORM:353098","LOINC:LP28491-6","NCIT:C61773","CHEBI:30830","KEGG.COMPOUND:C01991","NDDF:006073","UMLS:C0673093","MESH:C111420","NCIT:C61870","RXNORM:1546380","UMLS:C1170735","ATC:N07XX04","UMLS:C0000503","DRUGBANK:DB01440","DrugCentral:4566","UMLS:C1564128","RXNORM:9899","ATC:N01AX11","CHEBI:16724","NDDF:006074","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1342","VANDF:4021348","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00989","DRUGBANK:DB09072","HMDB:HMDB0000710","UMLS:C0037537","LOINC:MTHU013043","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1200682","MESH:D012978","KEGG.DRUG:D05866","REACT:R-ALL-880041"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:14595661","PMID:11101640","PMID:6809892","PMID:29028338","PMID:4269969","PMID:76561","PMID:2359869","PMID:16507620","PMID:11413487","PMID:7329448"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1200711":{"name":"OMEGA-3-ACID ETHYL ESTERS","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1200711","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1200711","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"An ethyl ester form of omega-3 fatty acid derived from fish oil, with activity in decreasing serum triglyceride levels.

Despite distinct structural differences between compounds in this class, SSRIs possess similar pharmacological activity. As with other antidepressant agents, several weeks of therapy may be required before a clinical effect is seen. SSRIs are potent inhibitors of neuronal serotonin reuptake. They have little to no effect on norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake and do not antagonize α- or β-adrenergic, dopamine D<sub>2</sub> or histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors. During acute use, SSRIs block serotonin reuptake and increase serotonin stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. Chronic use leads to desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. The overall clinical effect of increased mood and decreased anxiety is thought to be due to adaptive changes in neuronal function that lead to enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Side effects include dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction, and headache. Side effects generally occur within the first two weeks of therapy and are usually less severe and frequent than those observed with tricyclic antidepressants. Fluoxetine may be used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), moderate to severe bulimia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, and, in combination with olanzapine, for treatment-resistant or bipolar I depression.

Removing these bile acids helps to lower blood cholesterol.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Colesevelam (INN)","colesevelam hydrochloride","CholestaGel","Colesevelam hydrochloride (USAN)","Welchol","Colesevelam Hydrochloride","Colesevelam hydrochloride","colesevelam","COLESEVELAM","Colesevelam","COLESEVELAM HYDROCHLORIDE"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["RXNORM:284918","MESH:D000069472","ATC:C10AC04","UMLS:C1160749","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1201473","RXNORM:141626","NCIT:C28937","RXNORM:141625","VANDF:4029706","CHEBI:59594","CHEBI:59599","PDQ:CDR0000777636","UMLS:C0939530","UMLS:C0541154","NDDF:008852","KEGG.DRUG:D07743","UMLS:C0541155","VANDF:4021227","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1201677","KEGG.DRUG:D03582","DrugCentral:4405","NCIT:C78056","DRUGBANK:DB00930"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:22194678","PMID:15646539"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1201474":{"name":"COLESTIPOL HYDROCHLORIDE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1201474","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1201474","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121;

As a result, pitavastatin is less likely to interact with drugs that are metabolized via CYP3A4, which might be important for elderly patients who need to take multiple medicines. Pitavastatin (usually as a calcium salt) is a member of the medication class of statins, marketed in the United States under the trade name Livalo.

Accumulation of cholesterol sulfate in the skin is implicated in the pathophysiology of X-linked ichthyosis, a congenital disorder in which STS is non-functional and the body cannot convert cholesterol sulfate back into cholesterol. Cholesterol sulfate is quantitatively the most important known sterol sulfate in human plasma, where it is present in a concentration that overlaps that of the other abundant circulating steroid sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate (PMID 12730293). Cholesterol sulfate has a stabilizing function on the membrane, supports platelet adhesion and is involved in signal transduction (PMID 12730293). It plays a role in protecting erythrocytes from osmotic lysis and regulating sperm capacitation. Cholesterol sulfate can regulate the activity of serine proteases, e.g., those involved in blood clotting, fibrinolysis, and epidermal cell adhesion (PMID 12730293). As a result of its ability to regulate the activity of selective protein kinase C isoforms and modulate the specificity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, cholesterol sulfate is involved in signal transduction (PMID 12730293).

However, dietary mineral chelators help prevent over-mineralization of joints, blood vessels, and other parts of the body, which is most common in older persons.

It is also found in some birds, such as flamingoes, quails, and other species. This carotenoid is included in many well-known seafoods such as salmon, trout, red seabream, shrimp, lobster, and fish eggs. Astaxanthin, similar to other carotenoids, cannot be synthesized by animals and must be provided in the diet. Mammals, including humans, lack the ability to synthesize astaxanthin or to convert dietary astaxanthin into vitamin A. Astaxanthin belongs to the xanthophyll class of carotenoids. It is closely related to beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, sharing with them many of the general metabolic and physiological functions attributed to carotenoids. In addition, astaxanthin has unique chemical properties based on its molecular structure. The presence of the hydroxyl (OH) and keto (CdO) moieties on each ionone ring explains some of its unique features, namely, the ability to be esterified and a higher antioxidant activity and a more polar nature than other carotenoids. In its free form, astaxanthin is considerably unstable and particularly susceptible to oxidation. Hence it is found in nature either conjugated with proteins (e.g. salmon muscle or lobster exoskeleton) or esterified with one or two fatty acids (monoester and diester forms) which stabilize the molecule. Various astaxanthin isomers have been characterized on the basis of the configuration of the two hydroxyl groups on the molecule. The geometrical and optical isomers of astaxanthin are distributed selectively in different tissues and levels of free astaxanthin in the liver are greater than the corresponding concentration in the plasma, suggesting concentrative uptake by the liver. Astaxanthin, similar to other carotenoids, is a very lipophilic compound and has a low oral bioavailability. This criterion has limited the ability to test this compound in well-defined rodent models of human disease (PMID: 16562856). Astaxanthin is a carotenoid widely used in salmonid and crustacean aquaculture to provide the pink colour characteristic of that species. This application has been well documented for over two decades and is currently the major market driver for the pigment. Additionally, astaxanthin also plays a key role as an intermediary in reproductive processes. Synthetic astaxanthin dominates the world market but recent interest in natural sources of the pigment has increased substantially. Common sources of natural astaxanthin are the green algae Haematococcus pluvialis (the red yeast), Phaffia rhodozyma, as well as crustacean byproducts. Astaxanthin possesses an unusual antioxidant activity which has caused a surge in the nutraceutical market for the encapsulated product. Also, health benefits such as cardiovascular disease prevention, immune system boosting, bioactivity against Helicobacter pylori, and cataract prevention, have been associated with astaxanthin consumption. Research on the health benefits of astaxanthin is very recent and has mostly been performed in vitro or at the pre-clinical level with humans (PMID: 16431409). Astaxanthin is used in fish farming to induce trout flesh colouring.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["astaxanthine","astaxanthin","E-astaxanthin","Astaxanthin","ASTAXANTHIN"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["RXNORM:18451","VANDF:4031049","NDDF:013263","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1255871","CHEBI:40968","NCIT:C63653","UMLS:C0052565","UMLS:C2003085","MESH:C005948","HMDB:HMDB0002204","DRUGBANK:DB06543","KEGG.COMPOUND:C08580"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:16562856","PMID:11413487","PMID:16933864","PMID:20014752","PMID:17374880","PMID:16431409","PMID:23571415","PMID:20044567","PMID:19734910","PMID:16902246"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL136478":{"name":"SODIUM NITROPRUSSIDE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL136478","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL136478","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A powerful vasodilator used in emergencies to lower blood pressure or to improve cardiac function.

The molecular mechanism of its varied cellular effects has been studied in some details and it has been shown to have multiple targets and interacting macromolecules within the cell. Curcumin has been shown to possess anti-angiogenic properties and the angioinhibitory effects of curcumin manifest due to down regulation of proangiogenic genes such as VEGF and angiopoitin and a decrease in migration and invasion of endothelial cells. One of the important factors implicated in chemoresistance and induced chemosensitivity is NFkB and curcumin has been shown to down regulate NFkB and inhibit IKB kinase thereby suppressing proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Cell lines that are resistant to certain apoptotic inducers and radiation become susceptible to apoptosis when treated in conjunction with curcumin. Besides this it can also act as a chemopreventive agent in cancers of colon, stomach and skin by suppressing colonic aberrant crypt foci formation and DNA adduct formation. This review focuses on the various aspects of curcumin as a potential drug for cancer treatment and its implications in a variety of biological and cellular processes vis-à-vis its mechanism of action (PMID: 16712454). Turmeric (Zingiberaceae family) rhizomes, has been widely used for centuries in indigenous medicine for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory conditions and other diseases. Its medicinal properties have been attributed mainly to the curcuminoids and the main component present in the rhizome is curcumin. Curcumin has been shown to possess wide range of pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, wound healing and anti-microbial effects. Recently, curcumin treatment has been shown to correct defects associated with cystic fibrosis in homozygous DeltaF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) knock out mice. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated curcumin's ability to inhibit carcinogenesis at three stages: tumor promotion, angiogenesis and tumor growth. Curcumin suppresses mitogen-induced proliferation of blood mononuclear cells, inhibits neutrophil activation and mixed lymphocyte reaction and also inhibits both serum-induced and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent mitogenesis of smooth muscle cells. It has also been reported to be a partial inhibitor of protein kinase. The other salient feature of turmeric/curcumin is that despite being consumed daily for centuries in Asian countries, it has not been shown to cause any toxicity (PMID: 16413584).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Cyclostenol","curcumin","CURCUMIN","Curcumin","SID17389087"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["NCIT:C401","HMDB:HMDB0034401","PDQ:CDR0000043115","PathWhiz.Compound:1532","CHEBI:3962","DRUGBANK:DB11672","MESH:D003474","NDDF:017945","KEGG.COMPOUND:C10443","RXNORM:2955","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL116438","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL140","HMDB:HMDB0002269","UMLS:C0010467"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:26701186","PMID:16180819","PMID:24593150","PMID:24360557","PMID:29909338","PMID:25824662","PMID:24961640","PMID:19674905","PMID:24920381","PMID:19114310"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1401508":{"name":"SILIBININ","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1401508","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1401508","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A mixture of flavonolignans isolated from the milk thistle plant Silybum marianum.

Ethyl acetate exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Ethyl acetate is a sweet, anise, and balsam tasting compound. Ethyl acetate is found, on average, in the highest concentration within a few different foods, such as milk (cow), pineapples, and sweet oranges and in a lower concentration in safflowers. Ethyl acetate has also been detected, but not quantified, in several different foods, such as alcoholic beverages, oxheart cabbages, agaves, chervils, ryes, and peach. It is used in artificial fruit essences. In the field of entomology, ethyl acetate is an effective asphyxiant for use in insect collecting and study. Because it is not hygroscopic, ethyl acetate also keeps the insect soft enough to allow proper mounting suitable for a collection. In a killing jar charged with ethyl acetate, the vapors will kill the collected (usually adult) insect quickly without destroying it. In organic and in natural products chemistry ethyl acetate is often used as a solvent for reactions or extractions. Ethyl acetate is a potentially toxic compound. Ethyl acetate, with regard to humans, has been found to be associated with several diseases such as perillyl alcohol administration for cancer treatment, crohn's disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified; ethyl acetate has also been linked to the inborn metabolic disorder celiac disease.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Ethyl acetate","ETHYL ACETATE","Ethyl acetate (NF)","ethyl acetate","Acetic ester","Ethyl Acetate","acetate ester"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["CHEBI:47622","KEGG.DRUG:D02319","UMLS:C0059747","LOINC:MTHU003746","MESH:C007650","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00849","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL14152","KEGG.COMPOUND:C01883","LOINC:LP18253-2","CHEBI:27750","NCIT:C76707","HMDB:HMDB0031217","RXNORM:1314355"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:15857133","PMID:6502594","PMID:2033592","PMID:10866370","PMID:18558667","PMID:1271397","PMID:26462052","PMID:12061887","PMID:20363280","PMID:29254897"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1487":{"name":"ATORVASTATIN","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1487","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1487","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Atorvastatin is a member of the drug class known as statins, used for lowering cholesterol and thereby reducing cardiovascular disease.

(PMID:17168665). The flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds found as integral components of the human diet. They are universally present as constituents of flowering plants, particularly of food plants. The flavonoids are phenyl substituted chromones (benzopyran derivatives) consisting of a 15-carbon basic skeleton (C6-C3-C6), composed of a chroman (C6-C3) nucleus (the benzo ring A and the heterocyclic ring C), also shared by the tocopherols, with a phenyl (the aromatic ring B) substitution usually at the 2-position. Different substitutions can typically occur in the rings, A and B. Several plants and spices containing flavonoid derivatives have found application as disease preventive and therapeutic agents in traditional medicine in Asia for thousands of years. The selection of a particular food plant, plant tissue or herb for its potential health benefits appears to mirror its flavonoid composition. The much lower risk of colon, prostate and breast cancers in Asians, who consume more vegetables, fruits and tea than populations in the Western hemisphere do, raises the question of whether flavonoid components mediate the protective effects of diets rich in these foodstuffs by acting as natural chemopreventive and anticancer agents. An impressive body of information exists on the antitumoral action of plant flavonoids. In vitro work has concentrated on the direct and indirect actions of flavonoids on tumor cells, and has found a variety of anticancer effects such as cell growth and kinase activity inhibition, apoptosis induction, suppression of the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases and of tumor invasive behavior. Furthermore, some studies have reported the impairment of in vivo angiogenesis by dietary flavonoids. Experimental animal studies indicate that certain dietary flavonoids possess antitumoral activity. The hydroxylation pattern of the B ring of the flavones and flavonols, such as luteolin seems to critically influence their activities, especially the inhibition of protein kinase activity and antiproliferation. The different mechanisms underlying the potential anticancer action of plant flavonoids await further elucidation. Certain dietary flavonols and flavones targeting cell surface signal transduction enzymes, such as protein tyrosine and focal adhesion kinases, and the processes of angiogenesis appear to be promising candidates as anticancer agents. Further in vivo studies of these bioactive constituents is deemed necessary in order to develop flavonoid-based anticancer strategies. In view of the increasing interest in the association between dietary flavonoids and cancer initiation and progression, this important field is likely to witness expanded effort and to attract and stimulate further vigorous investigations (PMID:16097445).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Luteolin","LUTEOLIN","luteolin"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["KEGG.COMPOUND:C01514","NCIT:C68467","PDQ:CDR0000793029","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL151","PathWhiz.Compound:2570","MESH:D047311","UMLS:C0065264","DRUGBANK:DB15584","HMDB:HMDB0005800","CHEBI:15864"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:1800636","PMID:28988761","PMID:19729316","PMID:18258440","PMID:28858485","PMID:27802026","PMID:29110989","PMID:20202836","PMID:10757709","PMID:22823026"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1513":{"name":"IRBESARTAN","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1513","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1513","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist with antihypertensive activity.

Salicylates can be found in a number of food items such as arabica coffee, apple, common thyme, and rosemary, which makes salicylates a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products. Salicylic acid (from Latin salix, willow tree) is a lipophilic monohydroxybenzoic acid, a type of phenolic acid, and a beta hydroxy acid (BHA). It has the formula C7H6O3. This colorless crystalline organic acid is widely used in organic synthesis and functions as a plant hormone. It is derived from the metabolism of salicin. In addition to serving as an important active metabolite of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which acts in part as a prodrug to salicylic acid, it is probably best known for its use as a key ingredient in topical anti-acne products.

Without this enzyme, triglycerides from the diet are prevented from being hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids and are excreted undigested.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["ORLISTAT","Alli","Xenical","orlistat","Orlistat (JAN/USP/INN)","Orlistat","SID144204990","Ro-18-0647"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["RXNORM:37925","CHEBI:94686","DRUGBANK:DB01083","UMLS:C0732649","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL175247","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2354678","VANDF:4021159","ATC:A08AB01","KEGG.DRUG:D04028","UMLS:C1871879","HMDB:HMDB0015215","RXNORM:226918","UMLS:C4704765","NCIT:C29303","MESH:D000077403","RXNORM:708361","UMLS:C0076275","DrugCentral:1996"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:26873414","PMID:23153815","PMID:12007529","PMID:23062825","PMID:16180814","PMID:16078824","PMID:15646539","PMID:18363378","PMID:21282056","PMID:16377080"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1771":{"name":"CLOPIDOGREL","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1771","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1771","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A thienopyridine with antiplatelet activity.

Vitamin D3 is a steroid hormone that has long been known for its important role in regulating body levels of calcium and phosphorus, in mineralization of bone, and for the assimilation of Vitamin A. It is structurally similar to steroids such as testosterone, cholesterol, and cortisol (although vitamin D3, itself, is a secosteroid). Vitamin D3 is a derivative of 7-dehydroxycholesterol formed by ultraviolet rays breaking the C9-C10 bond. It differs from ergocalciferol in having a single bond between C22 and C23 and lacking a methyl group at C24. Vitamin D3 can also come from dietary sources, such as beef liver, cheese, egg yolks, and fatty fish (PubChem). The first step involved in the activation of vitamin D3 is a 25-hydroxylation catalyzed by 25-hydroxylase in the liver and then by other enzymes. The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyzes the first reaction in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates. The active form of vitamin D3 (calcitriol) binds to intracellular receptors that then function as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Like the receptors for other steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, the vitamin D receptor has hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains. The vitamin D receptor forms a complex with another intracellular receptor, the retinoid-X receptor, and that heterodimer is what binds to DNA. In most cases studied, the effect is to activate transcription, but situations are also known in which vitamin D suppresses transcription. Calcitriol increases the serum calcium concentrations by (1) increasing GI absorption of phosphorus and calcium, (2) increasing osteoclastic resorption, and (3) increasing distal renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through the formation of a calcium-binding protein.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["(R,Z)-3-((E)-2-((1R,3aS,7aR)-7a-methyl-1-((R)-6-methylheptan-2-yl)dihydro-1H-inden-4(2H,5H,6H,7H,7aH)-ylidene)ethylidene)-4-methylenecyclohexanol","SID29215240","cholecalciferol","vitamin D","colecalciferol","(S)-4-Methylene-3-{2-[(R)-7a-(R)-methyl-1-((R)-5-methyl-1-methyl-hexyl)-octahydro-inden-(4E)-ylidene]-ethylidene}-cyclohexanol","Cholecalciferol (JP18/USP)","CHOLECALCIFEROL","Cholecalciferols","Cholecalciferol","vitamin D3","calciol","Vitamin D3","VD3 [endoplasmic reticulum membrane]","VD3 [extracellular region]","Vitamin D","Vitamin d"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["RXNORM:1244014","PathWhiz.Compound:699","PDQ:CDR0000039734","UMLS:C0008318","PDQ:CDR0000467750","VANDF:4017667","RXNORM:11253","LOINC:MTHU008559","DRUGBANK:DB00169","ATC:A11CC05","LOINC:LP15456-4","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1042","DrugCentral:2840","NCIT:C48194","CHEBI:27300","MESH:D014807","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1949934","KEGG.DRUG:D00188","UMLS:C0242215","RXNORM:2418","UMLS:C3265062","VANDF:4021717","MESH:D002762","UMLS:C0042866","VANDF:4017649","KEGG.COMPOUND:C05443","LOINC:LP31696-5","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1365250","REACT:R-ALL-209767","LOINC:LA18888-0","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL432780","REACT:R-ALL-8963870","HMDB:HMDB0000876","CHEBI:28940"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:16886665","PMID:10676652","PMID:15149692","PMID:17629592","PMID:833826","PMID:24900716","PMID:22687748","PMID:28346348","PMID:184223","PMID:24885631"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1950045":{"name":"Hydroxytyrosol","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1950045","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL1950045","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A phenolic phytochemical naturally occurring in extra virgin olive oil, with potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cancer preventive activities.

Severe lack of niacin causes the deficiency disease pellagra, whereas a mild deficiency slows down the metabolism decreasing cold tolerance. The recommended daily allowance of niacin is 2-12 mg a day for children, 14 mg a day for women, 16 mg a day for men, and 18 mg a day for pregnant or breast-feeding women. It is found in various animal and plant tissues and has pellagra-curative, vasodilating, and antilipemic properties. The liver can synthesize niacin from the essential amino acid tryptophan (see below), but the synthesis is extremely slow and requires vitamin B6; 60 mg of tryptophan are required to make one milligram of niacin.

Eicosapentaenoic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid. In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:5(n-3). Its systematic chemical name is all-cis-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentaenoic acid. It also has the trivial name timnodonic acid. Chemically, EPA is a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and five cis double bonds; the first double bond is located at the third carbon from the omega end. Because of the presence of double bonds, EPS is a polyunsaturated fatty acid. Metabolically it acts as a precursor for prostaglandin-3 (which inhibits platelet aggregation), thromboxane-3, and leukotriene-5 groups. It is found in fish oils of cod liver, herring, mackerel, salmon, menhaden, and sardine.

Chemically, folate consists of three distinct chemical moieties linked together. A pterin (2-amino-4-hydroxy-pteridine) linked by a methylene bridge to a p-aminobenzoyl group that in turn is linked through an amide linkage to glutamic acid. It is a member of the vitamin B family and is primarily known as vitamin B9. Folate is required for the body to make DNA and RNA and metabolize amino acids necessary for cell division for the hematopoietic system. As humans cannot make folate, it is required in the diet, making it an essential nutrient (i.e. a vitamin). Folate occurs naturally in many foods including mushrooms, spinach, yeast, green leaves, and grasses (poaceae). Folic acid, being biochemically inactive, is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid and methyltetrahydrofolate by the enzyme known as dihydrofolate reductase. Tetrahydrofolate and methyltetrahydrofolate are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids and generate formic acid. Folic acid is used in the treatment and prevention of folate deficiencies and megaloblastic anemia. Folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during pregnancy to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in babies. Low levels in early pregnancy are believed to be the cause of more than half of babies born with NTDs (PMID: 28097362).

(NCI04); The orally bioavailable alpha form of the naturally-occurring fat-soluble vitamin E, with potent antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. Upon administration, alpha-tocopherol neutralizes free radicals, thereby protecting tissues and organs from oxidative damage. Alpha-tocopherol gets incorporated into biological membranes, prevents protein oxidation and inhibits lipid peroxidation, thereby maintaining cell membrane integrity and protecting the cell against damage. In addition, alpha-tocopherol inhibits the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC-mediated pathways. Alpha-tocopherol also modulates the expression of various genes, plays a key role in neurological function, inhibits platelet aggregation and enhances vasodilation. Compared with other forms of tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol is the most biologically active form and is the form that is preferentially absorbed and retained in the body.; A generic descriptor for all TOCOPHEROLS and TOCOTRIENOLS that exhibit ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL activity. By virtue of the phenolic hydrogen on the 2H-1-benzopyran-6-ol nucleus, these compounds exhibit varying degree of antioxidant activity, depending on the site and number of methyl groups and the type of ISOPRENOIDS.; Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin E is an antioxidant. It plays a role in your immune system and metabolic processes. Good sources of vitamin E include  Vegetable oils Margarine Nuts and seeds Leafy greens  Vitamin E is also added to foods like cereals. Most people get enough vitamin E from the foods they eat. People with certain disorders, such as liver diseases, cystic fibrosis, and Crohn's disease may need extra vitamin E.  Vitamin E supplements may be harmful for people who take blood thinners and other medicines. Check with your health care provider before taking the supplements.

Once converted from prothrombin, thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, which, in combination with platelets from the blood, forms a clot.    Medical thrombin is a protein substance produced through a conversion reaction in which prothrombin of bovine origin is activated by tissue thromboplastin in the presence of calcium chloride. Thrombin requires no intermediate physiological agent for its action. It clots the fibrinogen of the blood directly. Failure to clot blood occurs in the rare case where the primary clotting defect is the absence of fibrinogen itself.    Bovine thrombin however, is capable of causing fatal severe bleeding or thrombosis [FDA Label]. This thrombosis may result from the development of antibodies against bovine thrombin [FDA Label]. Bleeding may result from the development of antibodies against bovine factor V [FDA Label]. These antibodies may subsequently cross-react with endogenous human factor V and lead to its deficiency [FDA Label]. Patients who are know or suspected to have antibodies to bovine thrombin and/or bovine factor V should not be re-exposed to the product [FDA Label]. Patients who are administered bovine thrombin should be monitored for abnormal coagulation laboratory values, bleeding, or indeed, thrombosis [FDA Label].    A variety of human thrombin and recombinant thrombin (ie. thrombin alfa) products are available as alternatives to using bovine thrombin.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:NamedThing","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:Drug","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:Protein"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Thrombin (JP18/USP/INN)","THROMBIN","Thrombin","thrombin"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["CHEMBL.TARGET:CHEMBL1075308","LOINC:LP21102-6","RXNORM:10528","CHEMBL.TARGET:CHEMBL3078","ATC:B02BD30","NDDF:002069","CHEBI:9574","CHEMBL.TARGET:CHEMBL4471","PathWhiz.ProteinComplex:140","EFO:0003183","PathWhiz.ProteinComplex:10941","PathWhiz.ProteinComplex:10901","UMLS:C0040018","PathWhiz.ProteinComplex:10981","ATC:B02BC06","VANDF:4018534","NCIT:C87773","KEGG.ENZYME:3.4.21.5","LOINC:LP267657-7","CHEMBL.TARGET:CHEMBL204","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00752","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2108110","CHEMBL.TARGET:CHEMBL2040703","KEGG.DRUG:D00090","DRUGBANK:DB11300"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:367103","PMID:1011988","PMID:1011989","PMID:6370301","PMID:6326805"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2108117":{"name":"SITOSTEROLS","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL2108117","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL2108117","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Angelicin is found in coriander.

Epoetin alfa is a 165-amino acid erythropoiesis-stimulating glycoprotein produced in cell culture using recombinant DNA technology and is used for the treatment of patients with anemia associated with various clinical conditions, such as chronic renal failure, antiviral drug therapy, chemotherapy, or a high risk for perioperative blood loss from surgical procedures [FDA Label]. It has a molecular weight of approximately 30,400 daltons and is produced by mammalian cells into which the human erythropoietin gene has been introduced. The product contains the identical amino acid sequence of isolated natural erythropoietin and has the same biological activity as the endogenous erythropoietin. Epoetin alfa biosimilar, such as Retacrit (epoetin alfa-epbx or epoetin zeta), has been formulated to allow more access to treatment options for patients in the market [L2784].

Phytosterols are plant sterols found in foods such as oils, nuts, and vegetables. Phytosterols, in the same way as cholesterol, contain a double bond and are susceptible to oxidation, and are characterized by anti-carcinogenic and anti-atherogenic properties (PMID: 13129445, 11432711). beta-Sitosterol is a phytopharmacological extract containing a mixture of phytosterols, with smaller amounts of other sterols, bonded with glucosides. These phytosterols are commonly derived from the South African star grass, Hypoxis rooperi, or from species of Pinus and Picea. The purported active constituent is termed beta-sitosterol. Additionally, the quantity of beta-sitosterol-beta-D-glucoside is often reported. Although the exact mechanism of action of beta-sitosterols is unknown, it may be related to cholesterol metabolism or anti-inflammatory effects (via interference with prostaglandin metabolism). Compared with placebo, beta-sitosterol improved urinary symptom scores and flow measures (PMID: 10368239). A plant food-based diet modifies the serum beta-sitosterol concentration in hyperandrogenic postmenopausal women. This finding indicates that beta-sitosterol can be used as a biomarker of exposure in observational studies or as a compliance indicator in dietary intervention studies of cancer prevention (PMID: 14652381). beta-Sitosterol induces apoptosis and activates key caspases in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells (PMID: 12579296).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["beta Sitosterol","β-Sitosterol","Sitosterol","sitosterol, (3beta,24xi)-isomer","B-sitosterol","beta sitosterol","sitosterol","beta-Sitosterol","gamma-sitosterol","clionasterol","gamma-Sitosterol","Clionasterol","BETA-SITOSTEROL","Beta sitosterol"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["DRUGBANK:DB14038","LOINC:LP173720-6","CHEBI:27693","HMDB:HMDB0000649","PathWhiz.Compound:678","DrugCentral:2451","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL221542","UMLS:C0106127","LOINC:MTHU047889","MESH:C025473","VANDF:4021488","KEGG.COMPOUND:C19654","LOINC:LP185930-7","RXNORM:47070","HMDB:HMDB0000852","UMLS:C0891177","CHEBI:132823","UMLS:C0220914","KEGG.COMPOUND:C01753","CHEBI:176889"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:23062825","PMID:19716700","PMID:15824923","PMID:14640511","PMID:29622518","PMID:20100662","PMID:15867948","PMID:15270556","PMID:16477216","PMID:26900954"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2219536":{"name":"MIPOMERSEN","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL2219536","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL2219536","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T114; Mipomersen sodium, which was known as the investigational drug, isis-301012, is the salt form of a synthetic phosphorothioate oligonucleotide.

The average intake of the compounds by humans on a normal diet is more than 1 g per day. Although flavonoids are devoid of classical nutritional value, they are increasingly viewed as beneficial dietary components that act as potential protectors against human diseases such as coronary heart disease, cancers, and inflammatory bowel disease. Rutin acts as a quercetin deliverer to the large intestine; moreover, quercetin is extensively metabolized in the large intestine, which suggests that quercetin liberated from rutin and/or its colonic metabolites may play a role. Rutin's anti-inflammatory actions are mediated through a molecular mechanism that underlies the quercetin-mediated therapeutic effects: quercetin-mediated inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) activation. TNF-alpha-induced NFkB activity plays a central role in the production of pro-inflammatory mediators involved in progression of gut inflammation.

It is a lesser-known amino acid because it is not incorporated into the structural building blocks of protein. Yet taurine is an essential amino acid in pre-term and newborn infants of humans and many other species. Adults can synthesize their own taurine, yet are probably dependent, in part, on dietary taurine. Taurine is abundant in the brain, heart, breast, gallbladder, and kidney and has important roles in health and disease in these organs. Taurine has many diverse biological functions including serving as a neurotransmitter in the brain, a stabilizer of cell membranes, and a facilitator in the transport of ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Taurine is highly concentrated in animal and fish protein, which are good sources of dietary taurine. It can be synthesized by the body from cysteine when vitamin B6 is present. Deficiency of taurine occurs in premature infants, neonates fed formula milk, and various disease states. Several inborn errors of taurine metabolism have been described. Perry syndrome is an unusual neuropsychiatric disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion through three generations of a family. Symptoms began late in the fifth decade in 6 affected persons and death occurred after 4 to 6 years. The earliest and most prominent symptom was mental depression that was not responsive to antidepressant drugs or electroconvulsive therapy. Sleep disturbances, exhaustion, and marked weight loss were features. Parkinsonism developed later, and respiratory failure occurred terminally (OMIM: 168605). Hypertaurinuric cardiomyopathy describes congestive cardiomyopathy and markedly elevated urinary taurine levels (about 5 times normal). Other family members had late or holosystolic mitral valve prolapse and elevated urinary taurine values (about 2.5 times normal). In two with mitral valve prolapse, congestive cardiomyopathy eventually developed while the amounts of urinary taurine doubled (OMIM: 145350). Taurine, after GABA, is the second most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Its inhibitory effect is one source of taurine's anticonvulsant and antianxiety properties. It also lowers glutamic acid in the brain, and preliminary clinical trials suggest taurine may be useful in some forms of epilepsy. Taurine in the brain is usually associated with zinc or manganese. The amino acids alanine and glutamic acid, as well as pantothenic acid, inhibit taurine metabolism while vitamins A and B6, zinc, and manganese help build taurine. Cysteine and B6 are the nutrients most directly involved in taurine synthesis. Taurine levels have been found to decrease significantly in many depressed patients. One reason that the findings are not entirely clear is that taurine is often elevated in the blood of epileptics who need it. It is often difficult to distinguish compensatory changes in human biochemistry from true metabolic or deficiency disease. Low levels of taurine are found in retinitis pigmentosa. Taurine deficiency in experimental animals produces degeneration of light-sensitive cells. Therapeutic applications of taurine to eye disease are likely to be forthcoming. Taurine has many important metabolic roles. Supplements can stimulate prolactin and insulin release. The parathyroid gland makes a peptide hormone called glutataurine (glutamic acid-taurine), which further demonstrates taurine's role in endocrinology. Taurine increases bilirubin and cholesterol excretion in bile, critical to normal gallbladder function. It seems to inhibit the effect of morphine and potentiates the effects of opiate antagonists. Low plasma taurine levels have been found in a variety of conditions, i.e. depression, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, institutionalized patients, infertility, obesity, kidney failure, and others (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/). Moreover, taurine is found to be associated with maple syrup urine disease, which is an inborn error of metabolism.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:NamedThing","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:Drug","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["taurine","Taurine (JP18/USP/INN)","taurine zwitterion","TAU [cytosol]","TAURINE","Taurine","TAU [peroxisomal matrix]","TAU [extracellular region]"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["REACT:R-ALL-159420","CHEBI:15891","CHEBI:507393","UMLS:C0039350","NDDF:009160","VANDF:4018683","REACT:R-ALL-352014","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00245","HMDB:HMDB0000251","PathWhiz.Compound:171","REACT:R-ALL-193513","LOINC:MTHU004122","DrugCentral:4486","MESH:D013654","FOODON:03460847","KEGG.DRUG:D00047","PSY:51545","LOINC:LP15878-9","DRUGBANK:DB01956","RXNORM:10337","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL239243","NCIT:C61962"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:8692051","PMID:22304837","PMID:3393260","PMID:17765547","PMID:2370482","PMID:508122","PMID:16923232","PMID:25462220","PMID:32033212","PMID:22331997"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL24":{"name":"ATENOLOL","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL24","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL24","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Atenolol is a so-called beta1-selective (or 'cardioselective') drug. That means that it exerts greater blocking activity on myocardial beta1-receptors than on beta2 ones in the lung. The beta2 receptors are responsible to keep the bronchial system open. If these receptors are blocked, bronchospasm with serious lack of oxygen in the body can result. However, due to its cardioselective properties, the risk of bronchospastic reactions if using atenolol is reduced compared to nonselective drugs as propranolol. Nonetheless, this reaction may also be encountered with atenolol, particularly with high doses. Extreme caution should be exerted if atenolol is given to asthma patients, who are particularly at risk; the dose should be as low as possible. If an asthma attack occurs, the inhalation of a beta2-mimetic antiasthmatic, such as hexoprenalin or salbutamol, will usually suppress the symptoms. Atenolol (trade name Tenormin) can be used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, and treatment of myocardial infarction after the acute event. Patients with compensated congestive heart failure may be treated with atenolol as a co medication (usually together with an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic and a digitalis-glycoside, if indicated). In patients with congestive heart failure, it reduces the need for and the consumption of oxygen of the heart muscle. It is very important to start with low doses, as atenolol reduces also the muscular power of the heart, which is an undesired effect in congestive heart failure.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Atenolol","esatenolol","Atenolol (JP18/USP/INN)","Esatenolol (JAN/INN)","PROCATEROL HYDROCHLORIDE","Esatenolol","Procaterol hydrochloride","atenolol","ATENOLOL","ESATENOLOL","Procaterol hydrochloride (USAN)"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["NDDF:001855","PDQ:CDR0000590657","LOINC:MTHU015491","DrugCentral:4702","UMLS:C2825715","LOINC:LP16037-1","PathWhiz.Compound:1283","CHEBI:2904","UMLS:C0004147","KEGG.COMPOUND:C13235","CHEBI:32056","KEGG.DRUG:D02404","CHEBI:31556","DRUGBANK:DB00335","KEGG.DRUG:D01471","RXNORM:1202","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL343633","KEGG.DRUG:D00235","DrugCentral:255","VANDF:4018460","NCIT:C81661","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL24","DRUGBANK:DB13443","MESH:D001262","ATC:C07AB03","NCIT:C28836","HMDB:HMDB0001924","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1322218"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:28810189","PMID:25064578","PMID:18220330","PMID:26231155","PMID:26409259","PMID:21245286","PMID:20185316","PMID:6749509","PMID:19764786","PMID:27721153"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL241778":{"name":"SID56463084","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL241778","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL241778","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"The sodium salt of a synthetic lipid-lowering agent with potential antineoplastic activity.

Stimulating the H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect and increased permeability in the blood vessels which results in reduced endolymphatic pressure. Betahistine is believed to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs as well as by increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow. Doing so aids in decreasing symptoms of vertigo and balance disorders. Betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist which causes an increased output of histamine from histaminergic nerve endings which can further increase the direct H1-agonist activity. Furthermore, H3-receptor antagonism increases the levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin in the brainstem, which inhibits the activity of vestibular nuclei, helping to restore proper balance and decrease in vertigo symptoms.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Betahistin AL","SID8139951","BETAHISTINE","βhistine","Betahistine","Betahistine (INN)","betahistine hydrochloride","Betahistine hydrochloride","Mersilon","Betahistine Hydrochloride","betahistine"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["DrugCentral:346","KEGG.DRUG:D07522","UMLS:C0282071","UMLS:C1564538","NCIT:C83554","ATC:N07CA01","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1464589","CHEBI:35677","MESH:D001621","RXNORM:1511","DRUGBANK:DB06698","VANDF:4027336","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL24441","HMDB:HMDB0015644","NCIT:C73794","UMLS:C0005301","UMLS:C0917994","VANDF:4033254","RXNORM:81964","PathWhiz.Compound:9898"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:19456097","PMID:22194678","PMID:7731015"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2448878":{"name":"(4R)-4-[(1S,2S,5R,7S,9R,11S,15R)-5,9-dihydroxy-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadecan-14-yl]pentanoic acid","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL2448878","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL2448878","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Chenodeoxycholic acid is a bile acid.

Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g. membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID: 11316487, 16037564, 12576301, 11907135).

Aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid (acetosal) is a drug in the family of salicylates, often used as an analgesic (against minor pains and aches), antipyretic (against fever), and anti-inflammatory. It has also an anticoagulant effect and is used in long-term low-doses to prevent heart attacks and cancer. It was isolated from meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria, formerly classified as Spiraea ulmaria) by German researchers in 1839. While their extract was somewhat effective, it also caused digestive problems such as irritated stomach and diarrhoea, and even death when consumed in high doses. In 1853, a French chemist named Charles Frederic Gerhardt neutralized salicylic acid by buffering it with sodium (sodium salicylate) and acetyl chloride, creating acetosalicylic anhydride. Gerhardt's product worked, but he had no desire to market it and abandoned his discovery. In 1897, researcher Arthur Eichengrun and Felix Hoffmann, a research assistant at Friedrich Bayer & Co. in Germany, derivatized one of the hydroxyl functional groups in salicylic acid with an acetyl group (forming the acetyl ester), which greatly reduced the negative effects. This was the first synthetic drug, not a copy of something that existed in nature, and the start of the pharmaceuticals industry. The name 'aspirin' is composed of a- (from the acetyl group) -spir- (from the plant genus Spiraea) and -in (a common ending for drugs at the time). It has also been stated that the name originated by another means. As referring to AcetylSalicylic and 'pir' in reference to one of the scientists who was able to isolate it in crystalline form, Raffaele Piria. Finally 'in' due to the same reasons as stated above. Salicylic acid (which is a naturally occurring substance found in many plants) can be acetylated using acetic anhydride, yielding aspirin and acetic acid as a byproduct. It is a common experiment performed in organic chemistry labs, and generally tends to produce low yields due to the relative difficulty of its extraction from an aqueous state. The trick to getting the reaction to work is to acidify with phosphoric acid and heat the reagents under reflux with a boiling water bath for between 40 minutes and an hour. Aspirin acts as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase which results in the inhibition of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Aspirin also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis.

Stigmastanol is practically insoluble (in water) and an extremely weak acidic compound (based on its pKa). Stigmastanol can be found primarily in blood and feces, as well as in human skeletal muscle tissue. Stigmastanol can be found anywhere throughout the human cell, such as in in the peroxisome, in the cytoplasm, in the Golgi apparatus, and in the membrane (predicted from logP). It can also be found in the extracellular space. Moreover, stigmastanol is found to be associated with sitosterolemia, an inborn error of metabolism. Stigmastanol (sitostanol) is a phytosterol found in a variety of plant sources. Similar to sterol esters and stanol esters, stigmastanol inhibits the absorption of cholesterol from the diet. Animal studies suggest that it also inhibits biosynthesis of cholesterol in the liver (Wikipedia). Stigmastanol is plant stanol.

Apigenin inhibits the expression of involucrin (hINV), a marker of keratinocyte differentiation, is increased by differentiating agents via a protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), Ras, MEKK1, and MEK3 cascade that increases AP1 factor level and AP1 factor binding to DNA elements in the hINV promoter. Apigenin suppresses the 12-O-tetradeconylphorbol-13-acetate-dependent increase in AP1 factor expression and binding to the hINV promoter. Apigenin also inhibits the increase in promoter activity observed following overexpression of PKCdelta, constitutively active Ras, or MEKK1. The suppression of PKCdelta activity is associated with reduced phosphorylation of PKCdelta-Y311. Activation of hINV promoter activity by the green tea polyphenol, (-)-epigellocathecin-3-gallate, is also inhibited by apigenin, suggesting that the two chemopreventive agents can produce opposing actions in keratinocytes (PMID: 16982614).

It can be found in large concentrations within the liver, spinal cord, and brain. Cholesterol is an important component of the membranes of cells, providing stability. It is the major precursor for the synthesis of vitamin D, of the various steroid hormones, including cortisol, cortisone, and aldosterone in the adrenal glands, and of the sex hormones progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone. Cholesterol also has an important role for the brain synapses as well as in the immune system. In conditions featuring elevated low density lipoproteins (LDL), cholesterol often forms plaque deposits in the walls of arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease.; The principal sterol of all higher animals, distributed in body tissues, especially the brain and spinal cord, and in animal fats and oils.; What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. Cholesterol is also found in foods from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese. If you have too much cholesterol in your blood, it can combine with other substances in the blood to form plaque. Plaque sticks to the walls of your arteries. This buildup of plaque is known as atherosclerosis. It can lead to coronary artery disease, where your coronary arteries become narrow or even blocked. What are HDL, LDL, and VLDL? HDL, LDL, and VLDL are lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. Different types of lipoproteins have different purposes:  HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. Some people also call VLDL a \"bad\" cholesterol because it too contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. But VLDL and LDL are different; VLDL mainly carries triglycerides and LDL mainly carries cholesterol.  What causes high cholesterol? The most common cause of high cholesterol is an unhealthy lifestyle. This can include  Unhealthy eating habits, such as eating lots of bad fats. One type, saturated fat, is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. Another type, trans fat, is in some fried and processed foods. Eating these fats can raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol. Lack of physical activity, with lots of sitting and little exercise. This lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol. Smoking, which lowers HDL cholesterol, especially in women. It also raises your LDL cholesterol.  Genetics may also cause people to have high cholesterol. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited form of high cholesterol. Other medical conditions and certain medicines may also cause high cholesterol. What can raise my risk of high cholesterol? A variety of things can raise your risk for high cholesterol:  Age. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. Even though it is less common, younger people, including children and teens, can also have high cholesterol. Heredity. High blood cholesterol can run in families. Weight. Being overweight or having obesity raises your cholesterol level. Race. Certain races may have an increased risk of high cholesterol. For example, African Americans typically have higher HDL and LDL cholesterol levels than whites. Weight. Being overweight or having obesity raises your cholesterol level.  What health problems can high cholesterol cause? If you have large deposits of plaque in your arteries, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This can cause a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow in a coronary artery. If the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, it can cause angina (chest pain) or a heart attack. Plaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, including the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. How is high cholesterol diagnosed? There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high cholesterol. There is a blood test to measure your cholesterol level. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are: For people who are age 19 or younger:  The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke  For people who are age 20 or older:  Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years  How can I lower my cholesterol? You can lower your cholesterol through heart-healthy lifestyle changes. They include a heart-healthy eating plan, weight management, and regular physical activity. If the lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including statins. If you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes. Some people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may receive a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Then the machine returns the rest of the blood back to the person.

Primary alcohols are compounds in which a hydroxy group is bonded to a primary carbon, with the general structure RCOH (R=alkyl, aryl). Propyl alcohol is a colourless, volatile liquid that is fully miscible with water. It has a sweet odour and an alcoholic, fermented, fusel taste. Propyl alcohol exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Propanol can be produced through fermentation of sugars by bacteria and yeast and small amounts are produced by gut microflora. Propanol has been identified as a fecal biomarker of Clostridium difficile infection (PMID: 30986230). When ingested, 1-propanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to propionic acid leading to metabolic acidosis and an elevated anion gap (PMID: 18375643). It can be found in small amounts in alcoholic beverages such as wine. Industrially, the major use of 1-propanol is as a solvent as well as an intermediate in forming other industrially important compounds.  It is used as a carrier and extraction solvent for natural products, such as flavourings, vegetable oils, resins, waxes, and gums, and as a solvent for synthetic polymers, such as polyvinyl butyral, cellulose esters, lacquers, and PVC adhesives.  Other solvent applications include the use of 1-propanol in the polymerization and spinning of acrylonitrile, in flexographic printing inks, and in the dyeing of wool.  1-Propanol is used for both its solvent and antiseptic properties in drugs and cosmetics, such as lotions, soaps, and nail polishes (IPCS INCHEM, EHC 102). Both 1-propanol and 2-propanol are often used in hand disinfectants as they have excellent bactericidal activity.  1-Propanol is used less in industry than 2-propanol as it is more expensive and it is a toxicant that has a similar taste to ethanol, so 2-propanol is used as its unpleasant smell discourages abuse.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Propyl alcohol","Propane-1-ol","propan-1-ol","POLICOSANOL","1-propanol","1-Propanol","Propanol","propanol","Policosanol","policosanol","propyl alcohol","PROPANOL"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["MESH:C080710","DrugCentral:4332","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL14687","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL3707352","DRUGBANK:DB03175","RXNORM:1362872","KEGG.DRUG:D08398","KEGG.COMPOUND:C05979","LOINC:MTHU007487","UMLS:C0215278","PathWhiz.Compound:655","MESH:D000433","ATC:D08AX03","NDDF:008265","HMDB:HMDB0000820","UMLS:C0001964","NDDF:007055","VANDF:4021483","ATC:C10AX08","RXNORM:69440","CHEBI:28831","LOINC:LP19173-1","DrugCentral:5074","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL3137711"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:8810749","PMID:15646539","PMID:17544548","PMID:12926880","PMID:6630361","PMID:894678","PMID:15857133","PMID:12883225","PMID:6238790","PMID:8621199"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL3138392":{"name":"3-Hydroxy-10,13-dimethyl-hexadecahydro-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-17-one","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL3138392","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL3138392","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Androsterone is an inactive breakdown metabolite of testosterone, the product of a reaction mediated by the enzyme oxidative 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.51, 17beta-HSD). Androsterone can also be metabolized from other adrenal androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or androstenedione, and is considered an inactive end product. However, it can be a physiological effector in its own right. Androsterone might be converted back to dihydrotestosterone. Humans (and other primates) are unique among mammals in having high levels of circulating androsterone glucuronide, a process that is the major role of uridine-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (EC 2.4.1.17, UGT) for glucuronidation of steroid metabolism in humans. Conjugation of androsterone is a pathway found in all vertebrates and it is widely recognized that the liver is a major site of glucuronidation. However, it is now clear that extrahepatic tissues are also involved in the conjugation of compounds to which these tissues are exposed. High levels of androsterone glucuronide found in the human prostate, breast cyst fluid, and ovary follicular fluid suggest that glucuronidation of 5alpha-reduced C19 steroids occurs in these tissues as well. In doping control, the ratio of androsterone/etiocholanolone provides valuable information that allows the assignment of a urine specimen to a particular person or the identification of urine samples with identical steroid profiles; this is particularly important to detect attempts of urine manipulation including urine alteration and substitution (PMID: 9188497, 17017935, 14643063, 12943709, 9699884, 17260133).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["EPIANDROSTERONE","androsterone","3-Hydroxy-10,13-dimethyl-hexadecahydro-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-17-one","epiandrosterone","Epiandrosterone","Androsterone","ANDROSTERONE"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PathWhiz.Compound:21","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL272195","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL4303157","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL87285","HMDB:HMDB0000031","LOINC:MTHU003426","LOINC:LP15386-3","KEGG.COMPOUND:C07635","LOINC:LP230265-3","NCIT:C61747","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00523","MESH:D000738","NCIT:C29783","CHEBI:541975","UMLS:C0002865","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL3138392","LOINC:LP15551-2","RXNORM:1312359","CHEBI:16032","LOINC:MTHU010575","HMDB:HMDB0000365","UMLS:C0014483"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:15954157","PMID:8057280","PMID:22191644","PMID:27687674","PMID:7245287","PMID:2946134","PMID:12475725","PMID:16854065","PMID:14561088","PMID:12672239"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL3182014":{"name":"SID144206470","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL3182014","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL3182014","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121;

Tannic acid is also taken by mouth and applied directly for bleeding, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, bloody urine, painful joints, persistent coughs, and cancer.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["tannin","Tannins","TANNIC ACID","Tannic acid","tannic acid","Tannic Acid","Chinese gallotannin","Tannic acid (JP18/USP)","Tannin"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["CHEBI:26848","HMDB:HMDB0258711","UMLS:C0039294","VANDF:4018527","MESH:D013634","NCIT:C68538","RXNORM:10328","CHEBI:75211","KEGG.COMPOUND:C17409","DrugCentral:5039","NCIT:C66579","KEGG.COMPOUND:C13452","UMLS:C1456509","DRUGBANK:DB09372","CHEBI:81066","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL3215313","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL506247","KEGG.DRUG:D01959"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:2478667","PMID:28667872","PMID:27641467","PMID:28478866","PMID:1324983","PMID:23394144","PMID:30040425","PMID:20014752","PMID:1710653","PMID:15646539"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL331237":{"name":"TRICIRIBINE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL331237","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL331237","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"The phosphate salt of the synthetic, cell-permeable tricyclic nucleoside triciribine with potential antineoplastic activity.

Alpha-lipoic acid is also known as thioctic acid. It is a naturally occurring compound that is synthesized by both plants and animals. Lipoic acid contains two thiol groups which may be either oxidized or reduced. The reduced form is known as dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA). Lipoic acid (Delta E= -0.288) is therefore capable of thiol-disulfide exchange, giving it antioxidant activity. Lipoate is a critical cofactor for aerobic metabolism, participating in the transfer of acyl or methylamine groups via the 2-Oxoacid dehydrogenase (2-OADH) or alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA. This activity results in the catabolism of the branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine). Lipoic acid also participates in the glycine cleavage system(GCV). The glycine cleavage system is a multi-enzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to form 5,10 methylene tetrahydrofolate, an important cofactor in nucleic acid synthesis. Since Lipoic acid is an essential cofactor for many enzyme complexes, it is essential for aerobic life as we know it. This system is used by many organisms and plays a crucial role in the photosynthetic carbon cycle. Lipoic acid was first postulated to be an effective antioxidant when it was found it prevented vitamin C and vitamin E deficiency. It is able to scavenge reactive oxygen species and reduce other metabolites, such as glutathione or vitamins, maintaining a healthy cellular redox state. Lipoic acid has been shown in cell culture experiments to increase cellular uptake of glucose by recruiting the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane, suggesting its use in diabetes. Studies of rat aging have suggested that the use of L-carnitine and lipoic acid results in improved memory performance and delayed structural mitochondrial decay. As a result, it may be helpful for people with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. -- Wikipedia.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug","biolink:NamedThing","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Alpha lipoic acid","Neurium","Duralipon","Thioctacid","Alpha-Liponsaure Sofotec","alpha-lipoic acid","Alpha-Lipoic Acid","(R)-Lipoic acid","Thioctic acid","LIPA [extracellular region]","Alpha-lipoic acid","Pleomix-Alpha N","(R)-lipoic acid","LIPA [cytosol]","THIOCTIC ACID","alpha-Vibolex","(R)-(+)-lipoic acid","(R)-lipoate","(S)-lipoic acid","thioctic acid","Lipoate","Lipoic acid","Alpha-Lippon AL","Fenint","Juthiac","(S)-Lipoic acid","lipoic acid","LIPOIC ACID, ALPHA","Tromlipon","alpha-Liponaure Heumann","Thioctic Acid","Thioctic acid (JAN)","Azulipont","SID11111897","Lipoic Acid","Alpha-Lipon Stada","Thioctacide T","berlition","(R)-Lipoate","Biomo-lipon","lipoate"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["HMDB:HMDB0001451","PathWhiz.Compound:40836","VANDF:4021443","UMLS:C2713330","REACT:R-ALL-429608","UMLS:C2713346","REACT:R-ALL-429590","UMLS:C2713338","CHEBI:83088","CHEBI:30313","MESH:D008063","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL134342","UMLS:C2713334","UMLS:C2713326","NCIT:C61595","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00725","PathWhiz.Compound:1120","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL33864","UMLS:C2713332","CHEBI:30314","UMLS:C3643437","UMLS:C2713327","UMLS:C0023791","UMLS:C0178731","MESH:C532845","VANDF:4021484","UMLS:C2713322","HMDB:HMDB0014312","UMLS:C2713323","UMLS:C2713340","UMLS:C2713343","PDQ:CDR0000440740","CHEBI:16494","UMLS:C2713339","CHEBI:43796","PathWhiz.Compound:42563","UMLS:C2605365","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1234071","UMLS:C2713328","RXNORM:6417","UMLS:C2713342","DRUGBANK:DB00166","KEGG.COMPOUND:C16241","UMLS:C2713337","DrugCentral:4732","ATC:A16AX01","KEGG.DRUG:D00086","HMDB:HMDB0251530"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:2509239","PMID:14724823","PMID:12444669","PMID:7669066","PMID:19097798","PMID:12715971","PMID:8160293","PMID:21924801","PMID:24090916","PMID:15658850"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL34259":{"name":"METHOTREXATE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL34259","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL34259","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"An antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and immunosuppressant activities.

(\"http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI%20Thesaurus&code=C2190\" NCI Thesaurus); A volatile liquid prepared by fermentation of certain carbohydrates. Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.; A clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES.; Female score=3; Male score=3; If you are like many Americans, you drink alcohol at least occasionally. For many people, moderate drinking is probably safe. But drinking too much can be harmful, so it's important to know how alcohol affects you and how much is too much. How does alcohol affect the body? Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. This means that it is a drug that slows down brain activity. It can change your mood, behavior, and self-control. It can cause problems with memory and thinking clearly. Alcohol can also affect your coordination and physical control. Alcohol also has effects on the other organs in your body. For example, it can raise your blood pressure and heart rate. If you drink too much at once, it could make you throw up. Why are the effects of alcohol different from person to person? Alcohol's effects vary from person to person, depending on a variety of factors, including:  How much you drank How quickly you drank it The amount of food you ate before drinking Your age Your sex Your race or ethnicity Your physical condition Whether or not you have a family history of alcohol problems  What is moderate drinking?  For most women, moderate drinking is no more than one standard drink a day For most men, moderate drinking is no more than two standard drinks a day  What is a standard drink? In the United States, a standard drink is one that contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol, which is found in:  12 ounces of beer (5% alcohol content) 5 ounces of wine (12% alcohol content) 1.5 ounces or a \"shot\" of distilled spirits or liquor (40% alcohol content)  Who should not drink alcohol? Some people should not drink alcohol at all, including those who  Are recovering from an alcohol use disorder (AUD) or are unable to control the amount they drink Are under age 21 Are pregnant or trying to become pregnant Are taking medicines that can interact with alcohol Have medical conditions that get can worse if you drink alcohol Are planning on driving Will be operating machinery  If you have questions about whether it is safe for you to drink, talk with your health care provider. What is excessive drinking? Excessive drinking includes binge drinking and heavy drinking:  Binge drinking is drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Heavy drinking is having 15 or more drinks a week for a man. For a woman, it is having 8 or more drinks a week.  Binge drinking raises your risk of injuries, car crashes, and alcohol poisoning. It also puts you of becoming violent or being the victim of violence. Heavy drinking over a long period of time may cause health problems such as  Alcohol use disorder Liver diseases, including cirrhosis and fatty liver disease Heart diseases Increased risk for certain cancers Increased risk of injuries  Heavy drinking can also cause problems at home, at work, and with friends. But treatment can help.

It is necessary to maintain connective tissue and bone. The biologically active form of ascorbic acid is vitamin C. Vitamin C is a water soluble vitamin. Primates (including humans) and a few other species in all divisions of the animal kingdom, notably the guinea pig, have lost the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid and must obtain it in their food. Vitamin C functions as a reducing agent and coenzyme in several metabolic pathways. Vitamin C is considered an antioxidant (PubChem). Ascorbic acid is an electron donor for enzymes involved in collagen hydroxylation, biosynthesis of carnitine and norepinephrine, tyrosine metabolism, and amidation of peptide hormones. Ascrobic acid (vitamin C) deficiency causes scurvy. The amount of vitamin C necessary to prevent scurvy may not be adequate to maintain optimal health. The ability of vitamin C to donate electrons also makes it a potent water-soluble antioxidant that readily scavenges free radicals such as molecular oxygen, superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and hypochlorous acid. In this setting, several mechanisms could account for a link between vitamin C and heart disease. One is the relation between LDL oxidation and vitamins C and E. Vitamin C in vitro can recycle vitamin E, which can donate electrons to prevent LDL oxidation in vitro. As the lipid-phase vitamin E is oxidized, it can be regenerated by aqueous vitamin C. Other possibilities are that vitamin C could decrease cholesterol by mechanisms not well characterized, or could improve vasodilatation and vascular reactivity, perhaps by decreasing the interactions of nitric oxide with oxidants (PMID: 10799361). Moreover, ascorbic acid is found to be associated with hyperoxalemia, which is an inborn error of metabolism.

Indapamide exerts its diuretic effect by inhibiting reabsorption of sodium and chloride, primarily as a result of action on the cortical diluting segment of the renal distal tubule, thereby promoting urinary excretion of water and electrolytes.; A benzamide-sulfonamide-indole derived DIURETIC that functions by inhibiting SODIUM CHLORIDE SYMPORTERS.; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["indapamide","S-1520","Indapamide (JP18/USP)","INDAPAMIDE","Indapamide"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["DRUGBANK:DB00808","ATC:C03BA11","HMDB:HMDB0014946","PathWhiz.Compound:9272","DrugCentral:1433","UMLS:C0729107","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL406","NCIT:C29119","CHEBI:5893","UMLS:C0021186","MESH:D007190","NDDF:002313","KEGG.DRUG:D00345","VANDF:4018746","RXNORM:5764"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:19115843","PMID:20185316","PMID:26948801","PMID:23956101","PMID:24103428","PMID:29305297","PMID:19119014","PMID:22194678","PMID:18374572","PMID:20014752"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL4063304":{"name":"Tetrahydrobiopterin","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL4063304","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL4063304","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Sapropterin, also known as THBP or 6R-BH4, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as biopterins and derivatives.

Within the cell, sapropterin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. In humans, sapropterin is involved in catecholamine biosynthesis pathway. Sapropterin is also involved in a couple of metabolic disorders, which include aromatic L-aminoacid decarboxylase deficiency and tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. Sapropterin is converted from 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate by 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase.

Angiotensin II is produced locally within the kidney and mediates tissue injury through a series of nonhemodynamic effects. angiotensin II is not only involved in the regulation of blood pressure, water and sodium homeostasis, and control of other neurohumoral systems, but also leads to excessive production of reactive oxygen species and to hypertrophy, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of vascular cells. Angiotensin II is one of the main factors involved in hypertension-induced tissue damage. This peptide regulates the inflammatory process. Angiotensin II activates circulating cells, and participates in their adhesion to the activated endothelium and subsequent transmigration through the synthesis of adhesion molecules, chemokines and cytokines. Among the intracellular signals involved in angiotensin II-induced inflammation, the production of reactive oxygen species and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB are the best known. Classical, well-defined actions of Angiotensin II in the brain include the regulation of hormone formation and release, the control of the central and peripheral sympathoadrenal systems, and the regulation of water and sodium intake. As a consequence of changes in the hormone, sympathetic and electrolyte systems, feedback mechanisms in turn modulate the activity of the brain Angiotensin II systems. There are two Angiotensin II systems in the brain. The discovery of brain Angiotensin II receptors located in neurons inside the blood brain barrier confirmed the existence of an endogenous brain Angiotensin II system, responding to Angiotensin II generated in and/or transported into the brain. In addition, Angiotensin II receptors in circumventricular organs and in cerebrovascular endothelial cells respond to circulating Angiotensin II of peripheral origin. Thus, the brain responds to both circulating and tissue Angiotensin II, and the two systems are integrated.

The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is approximately 14:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by enzymes known as deiodinases (5‚Ä≤-iodinase). Thyroxine is synthesized via the iodination of tyrosines (monoiodotyrosine) and the coupling of iodotyrosines (diiodotyrosine) in the thyroglobulin. Iodine is critical to the synthesis of thyroxine and other thyroid hormones. Through a reaction with the enzyme thyroperoxidase, iodine is covalently bound to tyrosine residues found in the thyroglobulin protein, forming monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). Linking two moieties of DIT produces thyroxine. Combining one molecule of MIT and one molecule of DIT produces triiodothyronine. Thyroxine is released from thyroglobulin by proteolysis and secreted into the blood. Iodide is actively absorbed from the bloodstream and concentrated in the thyroid follicles where thyroxine is produced. If there is a deficiency of dietary iodine, the thyroid enlarges in an attempt to trap more iodine, resulting in a condition called goitre. More specifically, the lack of thyroid hormones will lead to decreased negative feedback on the pituitary gland, leading to increased production of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which causes the thyroid to enlarge, leading to goitre. Thyroxine can be peripherally de-iodinated to form triiodothyronine which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism.  Thyroid hormones function via a well-studied set of nuclear receptors, termed the thyroid hormone receptors. They act on nearly every cell in the body. In particular, thyroid hormones act to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, help regulate long bone growth (synergy with growth hormone) and neural maturation, and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness. The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. These hormones also regulate protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, affecting how human cells use energetic compounds. They also stimulate vitamin metabolism. Numerous physiological and pathological stimuli influence thyroid hormone synthesis. Levothyroxine, a manufactured form of thyroxine, was the most prescribed medication in the United States with more than 114 million prescriptions.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:NamedThing","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:Procedure","biolink:Drug","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["LEVOTHYROXINE","Levothyroxine Sodium","Levothyroxine sodium (USP)","Thyroxine","levothyroxine","LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM","THYROXINE","Levothyroxine sodium","T4 [cytosol]","Thyroxine, DL-","L-thyroxine zwitterion","levothyroxine sodium hydrate","L-thyroxine","thyroxine","Levothroid","Levothyroxine (BAN)","levothyroxine sodium","Novothyral","Synthroid","T4 [extracellular region]","Levothyroxine","thyroxine zwitterion"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PDQ:CDR0000039117","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL42115","RXNORM:224920","ATC:H03AA01","UMLS:C0040165","LOINC:LP270304-1","CHEBI:305790","PSY:53180","MESH:D013974","RXNORM:40144","KEGG.DRUG:D01010","UMLS:C2983962","HMDB:HMDB0000248","VANDF:4017826","UMLS:C0728762","VANDF:4022126","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2103741","NDDF:004881","DrugCentral:2646","UMLS:C0721345","CHEBI:58448","UMLS:C0733607","NCIT:C62080","RXNORM:218001","LOINC:LP145811-8","REACT:R-ALL-209937","REACT:R-ALL-352326","CHEBI:18332","UMLS:C0079691","PDQ:CDR0000528273","RXNORM:10582","NCIT:C2302","KEGG.DRUG:D08125","CHEBI:6447","LOINC:MTHU003562","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1624","PathWhiz.Compound:169","DRUGBANK:DB00451","LOINC:LP15900-1","NCIT:C90975","CHEBI:30660","PDQ:CDR0000039298","KEGG.COMPOUND:C01829","NCIT:C888"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:195056","PMID:11901210","PMID:9451592","PMID:6595194","PMID:3919186","PMID:14993604","PMID:12193297","PMID:15646539","PMID:18788725","PMID:7041647"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL426559":{"name":"LAROPIPRANT","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL426559","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL426559","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A prostaglandin D2 receptor (DP1) antagonist with niacin-induced vasodilation inhibiting activity.

Eugenol is used in perfumeries, flavorings and essential oils. It was first used for the manufacture of vanillin (https://doi.org/10.1021/ed054p776), though most vanillin is now produced from petrochemicals or from by-products of paper manufacture. Eugenol is hepatotoxic, meaning it may cause damage to the liver, if consumed in high doses. Eugenol has local antiseptic and anaesthetic properties (PMID:15089054 ; PMID:935250 ) and acts as positive allosteric modulators of the GABA-A receptor. It has high antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory activities with potential roles in alleviating and preventing cancer and inflammatory reactions (PMID:27771920 ).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Eugenol","Eugenol (USP)","eugenol [extracellular region]","EUGENOL","eugenol"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["NCIT:C75095","REACT:R-ALL-9737185","MESH:D005054","DrugCentral:4648","RXNORM:4186","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL42710","HMDB:HMDB0005809","VANDF:4019118","KEGG.DRUG:D04117","DRUGBANK:DB09086","KEGG.COMPOUND:C10453","CHEBI:4917","UMLS:C0015153"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:21674753","PMID:12444669","PMID:19157886","PMID:29407957","PMID:18314960","PMID:10543891","PMID:22775297","PMID:10888580","PMID:10836148","PMID:20226658"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL427216":{"name":"GLICLAZIDE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL427216","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL427216","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A short-acting, relatively high-potency, second-generation sulfonylurea compound with hypoglycemic activity.

Moreover, coenzyme Q10 is one of the most important lipophilic antioxidants, preventing the generation of free radicals as well as oxidative modifications of proteins, lipids, and DNA, it and can also regenerate the other powerful lipophilic antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol. Antioxidant action is a property of the reduced form of coenzyme Q10, ubiquinol (CoQ10H2), and the ubisemiquinone radical (CoQ10H*). Paradoxically, independently of the known antioxidant properties of coenzyme Q10, the ubisemiquinone radical anion (CoQ10-) possesses prooxidative properties. Decreased levels of coenzyme Q10 in humans are observed in many pathologies (e.g. cardiac disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, AIDS, cancer) associated with intensive generation of free radicals and their action on cells and tissues. In these cases, treatment involves pharmaceutical supplementation or increased consumption of coenzyme Q10 with meals as well as treatment with suitable chemical compounds (i.e. folic acid or B-group vitamins) which significantly increase ubiquinone biosynthesis in the organism. Estimation of coenzyme Q10 deficiency and efficiency of its supplementation requires a determination of ubiquinone levels in the organism. Therefore, highly selective and sensitive methods must be applied, such as HPLC with UV or coulometric detection. For a number of years, coenzyme Q (CoQ10 in humans) was known for its key role in mitochondrial bioenergetics; later studies demonstrated its presence in other subcellular fractions and in plasma, and extensively investigated its antioxidant role. These two functions constitute the basis on which research supporting the clinical use of CoQ10 is founded. Also at the inner mitochondrial membrane level, coenzyme Q is recognized as an obligatory co-factor for the function of uncoupling proteins and a modulator of the transition pore. Furthermore, recent data reveal that CoQ10 affects expression of genes involved in human cell signalling, metabolism, and transport and some of the effects of exogenously administered CoQ10 may be due to this property. Coenzyme Q is the only lipid soluble antioxidant synthesized endogenously. In its reduced form, CoQH2, ubiquinol, inhibits protein and DNA oxidation but it is the effect on lipid peroxidation that has been most deeply studied. Ubiquinol inhibits the peroxidation of cell membrane lipids and also that of lipoprotein lipids present in the circulation. Dietary supplementation with CoQ10 results in increased levels of ubiquinol-10 within circulating lipoproteins and increased resistance of human low-density lipoproteins to the initiation of lipid peroxidation. Moreover, CoQ10 has a direct anti-atherogenic effect, which has been demonstrated in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice fed with a high-fat diet.

Its use is now deprecated following introduction of alternative safer classes of agents. However it continues to have a role in otherwise difficult to treat hypertension and gestational hypertension (formerly known as pregnancy-induced hypertension). Methyldopa is an aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase inhibitor in animals and in man. Only methyldopa, the <i>L</i>-isomer of alpha-methyldopa, has the ability to inhibit dopa decarboxylase and to deplete animal tissues of norepinephrine. In man the antihypertensive activity appears to be due solely to the L-isomer. About twice the dose of the racemate (DL-alpha-methyldopa) is required for equal antihypertensive effect. Methyldopa has no direct effect on cardiac function and usually does not reduce glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. Cardiac output usually is maintained without cardiac acceleration. In some patients the heart rate is slowed. Normal or elevated plasma renin activity may decrease in the course of methyldopa therapy. Methyldopa reduces both supine and standing blood pressure. Methyldopa usually produces highly effective lowering of the supine pressure with infrequent symptomatic postural hypotension. Exercise hypotension and diurnal blood pressure variations rarely occur. Methyldopa, in its active metabolite form, is a central alpha-2 receptor agonist. Using methyldopa leads to alpha-2 receptor-negative feedback to sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (centrally and peripherally), allowing peripheral sympathetic nervous system tone to decrease. Such activity leads to a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) and cardiac output. When introduced it was a mainstay of antihypertensive therapy, but its use has declined, with increased use of other safer classes of agents. One of its important present-day uses is in the management of pregnancy-induced hypertension, as it is relatively safe in pregnancy compared to other antihypertensive drugs (Wikipedia).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:NamedThing","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["methyldopa","Methyldopa anhydrous","METHYLDOPA","alpha-methyl-L-dopa","Amodopa","Aldomet","Methyldopa","Dopamet","Methyldopa (INN)","(2S)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methylpropanoic acid"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["VANDF:4017896","RXNORM:6876","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL459","KEGG.DRUG:D08205","UMLS:C0591404","LOINC:LP16200-5","NDDF:000646","MESH:C579484","KEGG.COMPOUND:C07194","HMDB:HMDB0011754","UMLS:C3659953","NCIT:C47616","DrugCentral:1762","UMLS:C1709010","UMLS:C0025741","UMLS:C0591055","LOINC:MTHU016766","DRUGBANK:DB00968","MESH:D008750","PSY:31190","CHEBI:61058"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:17428028","PMID:21458999","PMID:22931300","PMID:15646539","PMID:18788725","PMID:21965623","PMID:6295709","PMID:10052994","PMID:6737413","PMID:20185316"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL475534":{"name":"NITRENDIPINE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL475534","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL475534","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; Nitrendipine is a calcium channel blocker with marked vasodilator action.

Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic I cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites.

An aldopentose is a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms, including an aldehyde (CHO) functional group. Arabinose gets its name from gum arabic, from which it was first isolate. Most saccharides found in nature are in the \"D\"-form, however, L-arabinose is in fact more common than D-arabinose. L-arabinose is found in nature as a component of biopolymers such as hemicellulose and pectin. L-arabinose is found in all organisms from bacteria to plants to animals. Arabinose is the second most abundant pentose in lignocellulosic biomass after xylose. There are two different arabinose utilization pathways in nature: bacterial and fungal. The bacterial pathway converts arabinose into xylulose-5-P via ribulose-5-P using three enzymes (L-arabinose isomerase, L-ribulokinase, and L-ribulose-5-P 4-epimerase) after which it enters the pentose phosphate pathway for ethanol production. The fungal pathway converts arabinose into L-arabinitol by aldose reductase (AR) or XR, L-xylulose by L-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (LAD), xylitol by L-xylulose reductase (LXR), D-xylulose by xylulose dehydrogenase (XDH), and D-xylulose-5-P by xylulose kinase (XK), and lastly enters the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway for further metabolism.  Arabinose has a sweet taste and is one of the most abundant components released by complete hydrolysis of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) of vegetable origin. Although widely present in nature, L-arabinose is rarely used in food production or food flavoring, and its physiological effects in vivo have received little attention. L-arabinose is known to selectively inhibit intestinal sucrase activity in a non-competitive manner. Sucrase is the enzyme that breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose in the small intestine. As a result, L-arabinose suppresses plasma glucose increase due to sucrose ingestion. The presence of arabinose in urine may indicate overgrowth of intestinal yeast such as Candida albicans or other yeast/fungus species. L-arabinose is also a microbial metabolite found in, and produced by, Mycobacterium (PMID: 16232643). In a rare case of two autistic brothers that were not associated with any known metabolic disease, it was found the median value for L-arabinose in their urine samples was 179 umol/mmol creatinine, nearly six times greater than normal children (PMID: 11238761, 8931641, 1390604, 7628083).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["beta-L-Arabinofuranose","Pectin (USP)","L-xylopyranose","Tetrahydro-pyran-2,3,4,5-tetraol","SID144211850","Beta-L-Arabinose","pectin","L-Xylopyranose","(beta anomer)D-5-Hydroxymethyl-tetrahydro-furan-2,3,4-triol","D-Arabinose","aldehydo-D-arabinose","aldehydo-L-arabinose","Alpha-L-Arabinose","alpha-L-Arabinose","Pectins","alpha-L-arabinopyranose","Calcium Pectinate","L-arabinopyranose","beta-D-arabinopyranose","Zinc Pectinate","Arabinose","L-arabinose","L-ARABINOSE","beta-L-Arabinose","Pectinic Acid","Pectin","beta-L-arabinopyranose","L-Arabinose","beta-L-arabinofuranose","alpha-L-arabinofuranose","2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxypentanal"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["NDDF:001149","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL505348","CHEBI:17309","CHEBI:6182","NDDF:001928","CHEBI:143528","KEGG.GLYCAN:G10591","RXNORM:32987","UMLS:C0030744","UMLS:C0003682","CHEBI:17535","UMLS:C4551611","CHEBI:46983","NCIT:C63647","UMLS:C0070203","LOINC:LP200272-5","CHEBI:46987","KEGG.COMPOUND:C02479","KEGG.COMPOUND:C11476","UMLS:C2936185","CHEBI:28272","DRUGBANK:DB03911","HMDB:HMDB0304537","ATC:A07BC01","NCIT:C68485","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL500808","CHEBI:46996","MESH:D010368","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00259","CHEBI:28772","CHEBI:59275","DRUGBANK:DB11158","VANDF:4018411","KEGG.COMPOUND:C02604","CHEBI:30849","HMDB:HMDB0000646","KEGG.DRUG:D02316","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1357418","UMLS:C2742092","PathWhiz.Compound:11163","DRUGBANK:DB03142","DRUGBANK:DB03246","MESH:D001089","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00714","CHEBI:40886","KEGG.COMPOUND:C20569","PathWhiz.Compound:505","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1374069","HMDB:HMDB0029942"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:2167807","PMID:11238761","PMID:16232643","PMID:26069505","PMID:1390604","PMID:9067088","PMID:7628083","PMID:7031247","PMID:19212411","PMID:8931641"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL501174":{"name":"LYCOPENE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL501174","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL501174","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"5-cis-Lycopene is a carotenoid found in human fluids.

Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. In animals, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a cofactor in various enzymes, and in copper-based pigments. In the body, copper shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms, though the majority of the body's copper is in the Cu2+ form. The ability of copper to easily accept and donate electrons explains its important role in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and in scavenging free radicals. Copper is a critical functional component of a number of essential enzymes known as cuproenzymes. For instance, the copper-dependent enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, plays a critical role in cellular energy production. By catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), cytochrome c oxidase generates an electrical gradient used by the mitochondria to create the vital energy-storing molecule, ATP. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which are essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. Another cuproeznyme, Monoamine oxidase (MAO), plays a role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO also functions in the degradation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is the basis for the use of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants. One of the most important cuproenzymes is Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD functions as an antioxidant by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals (free radicals or ROS) to hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently be reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes. Two forms of SOD contain copper: 1) copper/zinc SOD is found within most cells of the body, including red blood cells, and 2) extracellular SOD is a copper-containing enzyme found at high levels in the lungs and low levels in blood plasma. In sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous or even fatal to organisms. Copper is normally bound to cuproenzymes (such as SOD, MOA) and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. It is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other. An imbalance of zinc and copper status might be involved in human hypertension.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:Drug","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Cu2+ [mitochondrial intermembrane space]","Cupric cation","Cu2+ [Golgi lumen]","Cu2+ [melanosome membrane]","CuA [mitochondrial inner membrane]","COPPER","copper(0)","Cu2+ [cytosol]","Cu2+ [secretory granule lumen]","copper","Cu2+ [plasma membrane]","copper(2+)","Cu2+ [extracellular region]","Copper"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["KEGG.COMPOUND:C00070","NDDF:000853","DRUGBANK:DB09130","HMDB:HMDB0000657","REACT:R-ALL-164300","PSY:11800","VANDF:4017655","LOINC:MTHU003471","CHEBI:29036","REACT:R-ALL-351602","RXNORM:2837","PathWhiz.Compound:514","REACT:R-ALL-209799","CHEMBL.TARGET:CHEMBL2363057","NCIT:C391","CHEBI:28694","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL55643","MESH:D003300","REACT:R-ALL-3777113","CHEBI:30052","REACT:R-ALL-437295","REACT:R-ALL-936901","REACT:R-ALL-5668569","LOINC:LP16814-3","REACT:R-ALL-904823","UMLS:C0009968","DRUGBANK:DB14552"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:16466879","PMID:17079463","PMID:27049134","PMID:15511628","PMID:15256695","PMID:15543084","PMID:15156602","PMID:15253483","PMID:15552844","PMID:16382340"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL557555":{"name":"CIPROFIBRATE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL557555","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL557555","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A fibrate derivative with antilipidemic activity.;

During the last decade over 700 research articles have been published on triterpenoids research, reflecting tremendous interest and progress in our understanding of these compounds. This included the isolation and purification of these tritepernoids from various plants and herbs, the chemical modifications to make more effective and water soluble derivatives, the pharmacological research on their beneficial effects, the toxicity studies, and the clinical use of these triterpenoids in various diseases including anticancer chemotherapies. Ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpene acid, has been isolated from many kinds of medicinal plants, such as Eriobotrya japonica, Rosmarinns officinalis, Melaleuca leucadendron, Ocimum sanctum and Glechoma hederaceae. UA has been reported to produce antitumor activities and antioxidant activity, and is reported to have an antioxidant activity.

Clofibrate increases the activity of extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase (LL), thereby increasing lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis. Chylomicrons are degraded, VLDLs are converted to LDLs, and LDLs are converted to HDL. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. Clofibrate also inhibits the synthesis and increases the clearance of apolipoprotein B, a carrier molecule for VLDL. Also, as a fibrate, clofibrate is an agonist of the PPAR-&#945; receptor[4] in muscle, liver, and other tissues.

It has 90% the sweetness of sugar and nearly identical properties, except for browning. It is used to very easily replace sugar and has less food energy, does not promote tooth decay and has a somewhat lower blood sugar response. Unfortunately, maltitol is well known to cause gastric distress, particularly if consumed in great quantities. Chemically, maltitol is also known as 4-O-alpha-Glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol. Commercially, it is known under trade names such as Maltisorb and Maltisweet. Due to its slow absorption, excessive consumption of Maltitol can have laxative effect and often can cause gas and/or bloating. Maltitol is particularly demonized regarding gastric side effects because it is so easy for food producers to use it in vast quantities (due to its amazingly sugar-like properties) so consumers often end up consuming far more than they could most other sugar alcohols. While this is a major problem with maltitol, many sugar alcohols are far more likely to cause gastric distress than maltitol when compared gram-for-gram.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["maltitol","lactitol","Lactitol","MALTITOL","Lactitol (NF/INN)","LACTITOL","Maltitol (NF)","Maltitol","SID56320771"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["UMLS:C0065600","MESH:C014635","ATC:A06AD12","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1333305","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1661","HMDB:HMDB0002928","RXNORM:1363049","NCIT:C77138","HMDB:HMDB0040937","CHEBI:75323","DrugCentral:1534","MESH:C010745","NDDF:010095","KEGG.DRUG:D08266","DRUGBANK:DB12942","UMLS:C0064585","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL63558","RXNORM:28395","NCIT:C81025","CHEBI:68428","KEGG.DRUG:D04845"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:27153247","PMID:30199703","PMID:8913707","PMID:19351047","PMID:1802977","PMID:11413487","PMID:10841789","PMID:29132732","PMID:2751099","PMID:17374880"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL672":{"name":"FENOFIBRATE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL672","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL672","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A synthetic phenoxy-isobutyric acid derivate and prodrug with antihyperlipidemic activity.

Bupropion is a weak blocker of the neuronal uptake of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine and is a central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Bupropion may also reduce circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and normalize hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning, which is dysregulated in certain cases of cancer-related fatigue. The controlled-release formulation results in a higher concentration of the drug in the body over an extended period, thereby permitting a reduction in the frequency of dosing.; A propiophenone-derived antidepressant and antismoking agent that inhibits the uptake of DOPAMINE.; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Wellbutrin","Bupropion hydrochloride","buPROPion","Bupropion hydrochloride (JAN/USP)","Bupropion hydrobromide (USAN)","BUPROPION HYDROCHLORIDE","Bupropion","Zyban","BUPROPION HYDROBROMIDE","BUPROPION","Bupropion (INN)","bupropion"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["NDDF:004611","RXNORM:42347","CHEBI:3220","CHEBI:3219","DRUGBANK:DB01156","VANDF:4019645","HMDB:HMDB0001510","NCIT:C62012","LOINC:LP17172-5","MESH:D016642","ATC:N06AX12","KEGG.DRUG:D00817","KEGG.COMPOUND:C06860","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1698","UMLS:C0085934","KEGG.DRUG:D07591","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1201735","RXNORM:227948","RXNORM:42568","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL894","UMLS:C0751626","KEGG.DRUG:D07938","PSY:07081","LOINC:MTHU063022","DrugCentral:435","UMLS:C0085208"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:23924756","PMID:11052334","PMID:19256501","PMID:17428028","PMID:21458999","PMID:23728690","PMID:27141292","PMID:15646539","PMID:8558500","PMID:30203327"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL923":{"name":"RISEDRONIC ACID","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL923","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL923","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Risedronate is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug.

Risedronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Risedronic acid","Risedronate sodium (USP)","3,4-Dimethoxy-alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone","risedronate sodium","RISEDRONATE SODIUM","Risedronate sodium","risedronate","Risedronic acid (INN)","Risedronic Acid","Risedronate","Risedronate Sodium","risedronic acid","Actonel","RISEDRONIC ACID"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["RXNORM:753143","VANDF:4021112","PathWhiz.Compound:9337","HMDB:HMDB0015022","UMLS:C0246719","KEGG.DRUG:D00942","NCIT:C66517","UMLS:C1996201","NDDF:007621","VANDF:4024121","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL923","CHEBI:183772","RXNORM:73056","LOINC:LP171635-8","RXNORM:60334","UMLS:C0140610","CHEBI:8869","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1654","NCIT:C1528","PDQ:CDR0000256445","MESH:D000068296","DRUGBANK:DB00884","UMLS:C0166025","KEGG.DRUG:D08484","RXNORM:55685","CHEBI:8868","DrugCentral:2387","ATC:M05BA07","KEGG.COMPOUND:C08233"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:14695831","PMID:12014956","PMID:20394422","PMID:22931300","PMID:22884353","PMID:12086478","PMID:23318904","PMID:11277521","PMID:17149863","PMID:17870210"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL932":{"name":"DIPYRIDAMOLE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL932","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL932","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A synthetic agent derivative of pyrimido-pyrimidine, with antiplatelet properties.

Acetylcholine in vertebrates is the major transmitter at neuromuscular junctions, autonomic ganglia, parasympathetic effector junctions, a subset of sympathetic effector junctions, and at many sites in the central nervous system. Its physiological and pharmacological effects, metabolism, release, and receptors have been well documented in several species. ACh has been considered an important excitatory neurotransmitter in the carotid body (CB). Various nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors are present in both afferent nerve endings and glomus cells. Therefore, ACh can depolarize or hyperpolarize the cell membrane depending on the available receptor type in the vicinity. Binding of ACh to its receptor can create a wide variety of cellular responses including opening cation channels (nicotinic ACh receptor activation), releasing Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites (via muscarinic ACh receptors), and modulating activities of K+ and Ca2+ channels. Interactions between ACh and other neurotransmitters (dopamine, adenosine, nitric oxide) have been known, and they may induce complicated responses. Cholinergic biology in the CB differs among species and even within the same species due to different genetic composition. Development and environment influence cholinergic biology. Pharmacological data clearly indicate that both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have a role in the encoding of new memories. Localized lesions and antagonist infusions demonstrate the anatomical locus of these cholinergic effects, and computational modeling links the function of cholinergic modulation to specific cellular effects within these regions. Acetylcholine has been shown to increase the strength of afferent input relative to feedback, to contribute to theta rhythm oscillations, activate intrinsic mechanisms for persistent spiking, and increase the modification of synapses. These effects might enhance different types of encoding in different cortical structures. In particular, the effects in entorhinal and perirhinal cortex and hippocampus might be important for encoding new episodic memories. The role of ACh in attention has been repeatedly demonstrated in several tasks. Acetylcholine is linked to response accuracy in voluntary and reflexive attention and also to response speed in reflexive attention. It is well known that those with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders tend to be inaccurate and slow to respond. (PMID:17284361, 17011181, 15556286).

Aaron B.Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958. In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and. lowering the body temperature. Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood,learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant. Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders(ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits. were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:BiologicalEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["melatonin","MELATONIN","MLT [extracellular region]","Melatonin (JAN)","Melatonin","MLT [cytosol]","Circadin"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["MESH:D008550","DrugCentral:1672","KEGG.COMPOUND:C01598","DRUGBANK:DB01065","UMLS:C0025219","LOINC:MTHU002350","KEGG.DRUG:D08170","PathWhiz.Compound:1074","REACT:R-ALL-209934","CHEBI:16796","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL45","FMA:74644","NCIT:C2267","HMDB:HMDB0001389","REACT:R-ALL-419339","RXNORM:6711","PSY:30540","ATC:N05CH01","VANDF:4021324","UMLS:C1710381","LOINC:LP15036-4"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:27484514","PMID:12643943","PMID:30126274","PMID:14980664","PMID:21473625","PMID:10224140","PMID:12767050","PMID:7773197","PMID:8258829","PMID:15566297"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"FMA:81101":{"name":"Von Willebrand factor","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_81101","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_81101","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A high-molecular-weight plasma protein, produced by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, that is part of the factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Glycine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Glycine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid and is the simplest of all amino acids. In humans, glycine is a nonessential amino acid, although experimental animals show reduced growth on low-glycine diets. The average adult human ingests 3 to 5 grams of glycine daily. Glycine is a colorless, sweet-tasting crystalline solid. It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid. Glycine was discovered in 1820 by the French chemist Henri Braconnot when he hydrolyzed gelatin by boiling it with sulfuric acid. The name comes from the Greek word glucus or \"sweet tasting\". Glycine is biosynthesized in the body from the amino acid serine, which is in turn derived from 3-phosphoglycerate. In the liver of vertebrates, glycine synthesis is catalyzed by glycine synthase (also called glycine cleavage enzyme). In addition to being synthesized from serine, glycine can also be derived from threonine, choline or hydroxyproline via inter-organ metabolism of the liver and kidneys. Glycine is degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals and plants is the reverse of the glycine synthase pathway. In this context, the enzyme system involved glycine metabolism is called the glycine cleavage system. The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF:plasma glycine ratio (PMID: 16151895). Glycine levels are effectively measured in plasma in both normal patients and those with inborn errors of glycine metabolism (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/). Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM: 606899) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10, and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T-, and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM: 238300), AMT (OMIM: 238310), and GCSH (OMIM: 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. Glycine is involved in the body's production of DNA, hemoglobin, and collagen, and in the release of energy. The principal function of glycine is as a precursor to proteins. Most proteins incorporate only small quantities of glycine, a notable exception being collagen, which contains about 35% glycine. In higher eukaryotes, delta-aminolevulinic acid, the key precursor to porphyrins (needed for hemoglobin and cytochromes), is biosynthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA by the enzyme ALA synthase. Glycine provides the central C2N subunit of all purines, which are key constituents of DNA and RNA. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, especially in the spinal cord, brainstem, and retina. When glycine receptors are activated, chloride enters the neuron via ionotropic receptors, causing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:NamedThing","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Polypeptide","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:BiologicalEntity","biolink:OrganismTaxon","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Gly [synaptic vesicle]","glycine zwitterion","Gly [extracellular region]","Gly [mitochondrial matrix]","Gly [cytosol]","Glycine (JP18/USP)","GLYCINE","Gly [mitochondrial intermembrane space]","Gly [peroxisomal matrix]","polyglycine","Glycine","glycine"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["REACT:R-ALL-428557","PDQ:CDR0000041347","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00037","LOINC:LP15620-5","DRUGBANK:DB00145","NCBITaxon:1462605","DrugCentral:1319","CHEBI:15428","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL773","PathWhiz.Compound:78","MESH:C011080","FMA:82753","PSY:21220","MESH:D005998","REACT:R-ALL-193446","NDDF:000929","RXNORM:4919","UMLS:C0071583","HMDB:HMDB0000123","NCBITaxon:3846","NCIT:C524","REACT:R-ALL-266029","CHEBI:57305","KEGG.DRUG:D00011","ATC:B05CX03","LOINC:MTHU003091","UMLS:C0017890","REACT:R-ALL-113545","REACT:R-ALL-159549","REACT:R-ALL-29424","VANDF:4017980"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:22436388","PMID:20833035","PMID:10893301","PMID:16453318","PMID:22931300","PMID:9438018","PMID:24461352","PMID:10360746","PMID:30048132","PMID:12097436"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"FMA:82759":{"name":"Methionine","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_82759","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_82759","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Methionine (Met), also known as L-methionine, is an alpha-amino acid.

Methionine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Methionine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid. Methionine is an essential amino acid (there are 9 essential amino acids), meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. It is required for normal growth and development of humans, other mammals, and avian species. In addition to being a substrate for protein synthesis, methionine is an intermediate in transmethylation reactions, serving as the major methyl group donor in vivo, including the methyl groups for DNA and RNA intermediates. Methionine is a methyl acceptor for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (methionine synthase), the only reaction that allows for the recycling of this form of folate, and is also a methyl acceptor for the catabolism of betaine. Methionine is the metabolic precursor for cysteine. Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine (PMID: 16702340 ). There is a general consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethioninemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimum recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g. acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established (PMID: 16702341 ). Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, but there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. Acute doses of methionine can lead to acute increases in plasma homocysteine, which can be used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Sufficiently high doses of methionine can actually result in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times the normal amount resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid (PMID: 16702346 ). When present in sufficiently high levels, methionine can act as an atherogen and a metabotoxin. An atherogen is a compound that when present at chronically high levels causes atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of methionine are associated with at least ten inborn errors of metabolism, including cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency, homocystinuria, tyrosinemia, galactosemia, homocystinuria-megaloblastic anemia due to defects in cobalamin metabolism, methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase deficiency. Chronically elevated levels of methionine in infants can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems, delays in motor skills, sluggishness, muscle weakness, and liver problems. Many individuals with these metabolic disorders tend to develop cardiovascular disease later in life. Studies on feeding rodents high levels of methionine have shown that methionine promotes atherosclerotic plaques independently of homocysteine levels (PMID: 26647293 ). A similar study in Finnish men showed the same effect (PMID: 16487911 ).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:NamedThing","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:BiologicalEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["methionine zwitterion","L-Met [extracellular region]","RACEMETHIONINE","L-Methionine","METHIONINE","L-methionine","Methionine (USP)","Racemethionine (USAN)","methionine","L-Met [cytosol]","Methionine","Racemethionine","L-Met [cytoplasm]","L-Met [mitochondrial matrix]","L-methionine zwitterion"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL42336","LOINC:LP15730-2","HMDB:HMDB0033951","DrugCentral:3347","PathWhiz.Compound:548","LOINC:LP32571-9","KEGG.DRUG:D00019","NDDF:002867","CHEBI:16811","VANDF:4018672","PSY:31130","RXNORM:6837","CHEBI:16643","REACT:R-ALL-351966","REACT:R-ALL-1130765","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL274119","DRUGBANK:DB13972","REACT:R-ALL-174390","UMLS:C0025646","MESH:D008715","FMA:82759","REACT:R-ALL-379705","HMDB:HMDB0000696","KEGG.COMPOUND:C01733","LOINC:MTHU004104","KEGG.DRUG:D04983","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00073","DRUGBANK:DB00134","NCIT:C29600","LOINC:LP70164-6","CHEBI:57844","MESH:D064697","ATC:V03AB26","CHEBI:64558"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:16686542","PMID:1429978","PMID:12496196","PMID:15646539","PMID:10552150","PMID:30048132","PMID:402864","PMID:10803956","PMID:18869325","PMID:16619485"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"FMA:82763":{"name":"Arginine","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_82763","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_82763","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Arginine (Arg), also known as L-argninine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as L-alpha-amino acids. These are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-asparagine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Arginine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. Arginine is an essential amino acid that is physiologically active in the L-form. It is classified as a charged, basic, aliphatic amino acid. Arginine is considered to be a basic amino acid as it has a strongly basic guanidinium group. With a pKa of 12.48, the guanidinium group is positively charged in neutral, acidic, and even most basic environments. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized. This group is able to form multiple H-bonds. In mammals, arginine is formally classified as a semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Infants are unable to effectively synthesize arginine, making it nutritionally essential for infants. Adults, however, are able to synthesize arginine in the urea cycle. L-Arginine is an amino acid that has numerous functions in the body. It helps dispose of ammonia, is used to make compounds such as nitric oxide, creatine, L-glutamate, and L-proline, and it can be converted into glucose and glycogen if needed. Arginine also plays an important role in cell division, immunity and wound healing. Arginine is the immediate precursor of nitric oxide (NO), an important signaling molecule which can act as a second messenger, as well as an intercellular messenger which regulates vasodilation, and also has functions in the immune system's reaction to infection. Nitric oxide is made via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (PMID 10690324). Arginine is also a precursor for several important nitrogen-containing compounds including urea, ornithine, and agmatine. Arginine is necessary for the synthesis of creatine and can be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine, citrulline, and glutamate.) The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in serum or plasma, a close relative of argninine, inhibits the nitric oxide synthase reaction. ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as L-arginine is considered a sign of a healthy endothelium. In large doses, L-arginine also stimulates the release of the hormones growth hormone and prolactin. Arginine is a known inducer of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and is responsible for inducing protein synthesis through the mTOR pathway. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin partially reduces arginine-induced protein synthesis (PMID: 20841502). Catabolic disease states such as sepsis, injury, and cancer cause an increase in arginine utilization, which can exceed normal body production, leading to arginine depletion. Arginine also activates AMP kinase (AMPK) which then stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose uptake, thereby increasing insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells (PMID: 21311355). Arginine is found in plant and animal proteins, such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and nuts. The ratio of L-arginine to lysine is also important: soy and other plant proteins have more L-arginine than animal sources of protein.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:NamedThing","biolink:BiologicalEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Arginine hydrochloride","ARGININE","Arginine","L-Arginine","ARGININE HYDROCHLORIDE","arginine hydrochloride","L-arginine","Arginine (USP/INN)","Arginine hydrochloride (USP)","Arginine Hydrochloride","arginine"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["UMLS:C0003765","HMDB:HMDB0000517","RXNORM:89918","NDDF:000926","PDQ:CDR0000793609","DrugCentral:1549","NCIT:C62008","RXNORM:1091","LOINC:LP32575-0","LOINC:LP70357-6","ATC:B05XB01","KEGG.DRUG:D02982","CHEBI:16467","VANDF:4019067","DRUGBANK:DB00125","HMDB:HMDB0303361","UMLS:C0301556","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1200381","NCIT:C29606","CHEBI:31235","LOINC:LP15416-8","PathWhiz.Compound:396","KEGG.DRUG:D01126","KEGG.DRUG:D06483","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00062","VANDF:4018668","FMA:82763","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1485","LOINC:MTHU004112","MESH:D001120"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:10215651","PMID:15043412","PMID:18681417","PMID:17895252","PMID:18838585","PMID:30048132","PMID:3433275","PMID:19261478","PMID:11312922","PMID:18328700"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"FMA:82779":{"name":"Phospholipid","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_82779","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_82779","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T123; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with a double bond at the third carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain.

LPS is the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, contributing greatly to the structural integrity of the bacteria, and protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attack. LPS also increases the negative charge of the cell membrane and helps stabilize the overall membrane structure. It is of crucial importance to gram negative bacteria, whose death results if it is mutated or removed. LPS is an endotoxin, and induces a strong response from normal animal immune systems. LPS acts as the prototypical endotoxin because it binds the CD14/TLR4/MD2 receptor complex, which promotes the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in many cell types, but especially in macrophages. In Immunology, the term \"LPS challenge\" refers to the process of exposing a subject to an LPS which may act as a toxin. LPS is also an exogenous pyrogen (external fever-inducing substance). Being of crucial importance to gram negative bacteria, these molecules make candidate targets for new antimicrobial agents. LPS comprises three parts: 1. O antigen (or O polysaccharide). 2. Core polysaccharide. 3. Lipid A. The making of LPS can be modified in order to present a specific sugar structure. Those can be recognised by either other LPS (which enables to inhibit LPS toxins) or glycosyltransferases which use those sugar structure to add more specific sugars. It has recently been shown that a specific enzyme in the intestine (alkaline phosphatase) can detoxify LPS by removing the two phosphate groups found on LPS carbohydrates [6]. This may function as an adaptive mechanism to help the host manage potentially toxic effects of gram-negative bacteria normally found in the small intestine. (from wiki).

Inositol is a derivative of cyclohexane with six hydroxyl groups, making it a polyol. It also is known as a sugar alcohol, having exactly the same molecular formula as glucose or other hexoses. Inositol exists in nine possible stereoisomers, of which cis-1,2,3,5-trans-4,6-cyclohexanehexol, or myo-inositol is the most widely occurring form in nature. The other known inositols include scyllo-inositol, muco-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, L-chiro-inositol, neo-inositol, allo-inositol, epi-inositol and cis-inositol. myo-Inositol is found naturally in many foods (particularly in cereals with high bran content) and can be used as a sweetner as it has half the sweetness of sucrose (table sugar). myo-Inositol was once considered a member of the vitamin B complex and given the name: vitamin B8. However, because it is produced by the human body from glucose, it is not an essential nutrient, and therefore cannot be called a vitamin. myo-Inositol is a precursor molecule for a number of secondary messengers including various inositol phosphates. In addition, inositol/myo-inositol is an important component of the lipids known as phosphatidylinositol (PI) phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP). myo-Inositol is synthesized from glucose, via glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in two steps. First, G-6-P is isomerised by an inositol-3-phosphate synthase enzyme to myo-inositol 1-phosphate, which is then dephosphorylated by an inositol monophosphatase enzyme to give free myo-inositol. In humans, myo-inositol is primarily synthesized in the kidneys at a rate of a few grams per day. myo-Inositol can be used in the management of preterm babies who have or are at a risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome. It is also used as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It works by increasing insulin sensitivity, which helps to improve ovarian function and reduce hyperandrogenism. Reduced levels of myo-inositol have been found in the spinal fluid of depressed patients and levels are significantly reduced in brain samples of suicide victims.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:BiologicalEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Ins [extracellular region]","myo-inositol","Inositol","Ins [cytosol]","Inositol (NF)","myo-Inositol","Myo-inositol","inositol","INOSITOL"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["NDDF:002057","HMDB:HMDB0000211","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1222251","NCIT:C28163","RXNORM:5833","UMLS:C0021547","REACT:R-ALL-426910","PathWhiz.Compound:137","CHEBI:24848","FMA:82800","REACT:R-ALL-429130","ATC:A11HA07","ttd.target:Myo-inositol","MESH:D007294","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00137","DRUGBANK:DB13178","LOINC:LP64093-5","DrugCentral:1444","CHEBI:17268","KEGG.DRUG:D08079","PDQ:CDR0000305828","VANDF:4017688"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:19551544","PMID:18074942","PMID:27074126","PMID:21845803","PMID:24501149","PMID:11105023","PMID:23641877","PMID:22656408","PMID:7710082","PMID:11386498"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"FMA:82816":{"name":"Ganglioside","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_82816","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_82816","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Sialoglycosphingolipids (synonym: gangliosides) are glycosphingolipids carrying one or more sialic residues.

It is used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and is given as a subcutaneous injection. Enoxaparin binds to and accelerates the activity of antithrombin III. By activating antithrombin III, enoxaparin preferentially potentiates the inhibition of coagulation factors Xa and IIa. Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, so enoxaparin's inhibition of this process results in decreased thrombin and ultimately the prevention of fibrin clot formation. Low molecular weight heparins are less effective at inactivating factor IIa due to their shorter length compared to unfractionated heparin.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:BiologicalEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["heparin sodium","HEPARIN CALCIUM","Heparin sodium","heparin calcium","heparin, porcine","Heparinsodiumsalt","Heparin Calcium","Heparin sodium (JP18/USP/INN)","HEPARIN SODIUM","HEPARIN","Heparin","SODIUM HEPARIN","Heparin Sodium","Sodium heparin","heparin","Heparin calcium"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["CHEBI:28304","KEGG.GLYCAN:G00932","ATC:C05BA03","VANDF:4017546","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL526514","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL4128407","NCIT:C539","UMLS:C0019134","CHEMBL.TARGET:CHEMBL2364712","KEGG.GLYCAN:G03495","KEGG.GLYCAN:G01158","LOINC:LP15998-5","RXNORM:5224","KEGG.GLYCAN:G00338","LOINC:LA24058-2","PDQ:CDR0000791439","VANDF:4017549","ATC:S01XA14","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00374","NCIT:C833","NDDF:015153","DRUGBANK:DB01109","DrugCentral:1358","RXNORM:9877","PathWhiz.Compound:1078","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1909300","ATC:B01AB01","KEGG.GLYCAN:G05144","CHEBI:151315","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1201513","VANDF:4018538","LOINC:MTHU003766","PSY:22750","HMDB:HMDB0258358","UMLS:C0770546","PDQ:CDR0000040848","ttd.target:Heparin_Calcium","UMLS:C0054452","RXNORM:20044","HMDB:HMDB0001394","UMLS:C0037513","ttd.target:Heparin_Sodium","KEGG.GLYCAN:G00797","MESH:D006493","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1201657","RXNORM:235473","FMA:82839","NCIT:C1034","KEGG.GLYCAN:G00609","KEGG.DRUG:D02112"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:15383472","PMID:16709700","PMID:15646539","PMID:2331699","PMID:16305714","PMID:31557052","PMID:29631958","PMID:22194678","PMID:10549711","PMID:16382263"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"FMA:83353":{"name":"Steroid hormone","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_83353","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_83353","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Any steroid that acts as hormone.; Any steroid that act as hormone.; Any steroid that acts as hormone.; Any steroid that acts as hormone.; Any steroid that acts as hormone.; Any steroid that acts as hormone.; Any steroid that acts as hormone.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:BiologicalEntity","biolink:Drug","biolink:MolecularEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["steroid hormone","Steroid hormone","Steroid Hormone"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["FMA:83353","CHEBI:26764","UMLS:C0301818","NCIT:C2289"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null}]},"FMA:83358":{"name":"Prolactin","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_83358","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_83358","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A lactogenic hormone secreted by the adenohypophysis (PITUITARY GLAND, ANTERIOR).

In winemaking, it can be used as a fining agent, also helping to prevent spoilage. In industry, it can be used in a self-healing polyurethane paint coating. In medicine, it is useful in bandages to reduce bleeding and as an antibacterial agent; it can also be used to help deliver drugs through the skin. Chitosan is produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin, which is the structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans (such as crabs and shrimp) and cell walls of fungi. It is used in hydrogel and to treat wounds. Chitosan can also be used in water processing engineering as a part of a filtration process. Chitosan causes the fine sediment particles to bind together and is subsequently removed with the sediment during sand filtration. Chitosan also removes phosphorous, heavy minerals, and oils from the water. Chitosan is an important additive in the filtration process.

Your body can also make vitamins D and K. People who eat a vegetarian diet may need to take a vitamin B12 supplement.  Each vitamin has specific jobs. If you have low levels of certain vitamins, you may get health problems. For example, if you don't get enough vitamin C, you could become anemic. Some vitamins may help prevent medical problems. Vitamin A prevents night blindness. The best way to get enough vitamins is to eat a balanced diet with a variety of foods. In some cases, you may need to take vitamin supplements.
