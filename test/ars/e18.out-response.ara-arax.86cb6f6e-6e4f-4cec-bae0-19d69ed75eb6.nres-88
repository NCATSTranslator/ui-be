It appears colorless to the naked eye in small quantities, though it is actually slightly blue in color. It covers 71% of Earth's surface. Current estimates suggest that there are 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (330 million m3) of it available on Earth, and it exists in many forms. It appears mostly in the oceans (saltwater) and polar ice caps, but it is also present as clouds, rain water, rivers, freshwater aquifers, lakes, and sea ice. Water in these bodies perpetually moves through a cycle of evaporation, precipitation, and runoff to the sea. Clean water is essential to human life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply. From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life that set it apart from other substances. It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Water is thus essential and central to these metabolic processes. Water is also central to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO2 (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO2 in the process (cellular respiration). Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H+, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as hydroxide ion (OH-) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a pH (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. Acids have pH values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7. Stomach acid (HCl) is useful to digestion. However, its corrosive effect on the esophagus during reflux can temporarily be neutralized by ingestion of a base such as aluminum hydroxide to produce the neutral molecules water and the salt aluminum chloride. Human biochemistry that involves enzymes usually performs optimally around a biologically neutral pH of 7.4.

Its primary significance is in the prevention and/or cure of blacktongue and pellagra. The structure of nicotinamide consists of a pyridine ring to which a primary amide group is attached in the meta position. It is an amide of nicotinic acid. As an aromatic compound, it undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions and transformations of its two functional groups. Niacinamide and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate can be converted into nicotinic acid mononucleotide and phosphate by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. In humans, niacinamide is involved in the metabolic disorder called the nad+ signalling pathway (cancer). Niacinamide is an odorless tasting compound. Outside of the human body, niacinamide is found, on average, in the highest concentration within a few different foods, such as common sages, cow milk, and cocoa beans and in a lower concentration in common pea. Niacinamide has also been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as yardlong beans, roselles, apples, oyster mushrooms, and swiss chards. Niacinamide occurs in trace amounts mainly in meat, fish, nuts, and mushrooms, as well as to a lesser extent in some vegetables. It is commonly added to cereals and other foods. Many multivitamins contain 20–30 mg of vitamin B3 and it is also available in higher doses.

It is a chiral molecule, consisting of two optical isomers, L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid, with the L-isomer being the most common in living organisms. Lactic acid plays a role in several biochemical processes and is produced in the muscles during intense activity. In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal. This is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, lactate concentration, the isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually 1-2 mmol/L at rest, but can rise to over 20 mmol/L during intense exertion. There are some indications that lactate, and not glucose, is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brain of several mammalian species, including mice, rats, and humans. Glial cells, using the lactate shuttle, are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. Lactate measurement in critically ill patients has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcomes. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms adapt in many different ways, up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow tissues and cells to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may, therefore, be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state (PMID: 16356243). When present in sufficiently high levels, lactic acid can act as an oncometabolite, an immunosuppressant, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumor growth and survival. An immunosuppressant reduces or arrests the activity of the immune system. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of lactic acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, biotinidase deficiency, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1A (GSD1A) or Von Gierke disease, glycogenosis type IB, glycogenosis type IC, glycogenosis type VI, Hers disease, lactic acidemia, Leigh syndrome, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate decarboxylase E1 component deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency). Locally high concentrations of lactic acid or lactate are found near many tumors due to the upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase (PMID: 15279558). Lactic acid produced by tumors through aerobic glycolysis acts as an immunosuppressant and tumor promoter (PMID: 23729358). Indeed, lactic acid has been found to be a key player or regulator in the development and malignant progression of a variety of cancers (PMID: 22084445). A number of studies have demonstrated that malignant transformation is associated with an increase in aerobic cellular lactate excretion. Lactate concentrations in various carcinomas (e.g. uterine cervix, head and neck, colorectal region) at first diagnosis of the disease, can be relatively low or extremely high (up to 40 µmol/g) in different individual tumors or within the same lesion (PMID: 15279558). High molar concentrations of lactate are correlated with a high incidence of distant metastasis. Low lactate tumors (< median of approximately 8 µmol/g) are associated with both an overall longer and disease-free survival compared to high lactate lesions (lactate > approximately 8 µmol/g). Lactate-induced secretion of hyaluronan by tumor-associated fibroblasts creates a milieu favourable for cell migration and metastases (PMID: 22084445). An acidic environment (pH 6-6.5), which is common in many tumors, allows tumor cells to evade the immune response, and therefore allows them to grow unchecked. Locally high concentrations of lactic acid are known to markedly impede the function of normal immune cells and will lead to a loss of T-cell function of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (PMID: 22084445). Lactic acid is also an organic acid and acts as a general acidogen. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy).

It is the simplest and smallest ketone. It is a colourless, highly volatile and flammable liquid with a characteristic pungent odour. Acetone is miscible with water and serves as an important organic solvent in its own right, in industry, home, and laboratory. Acetone is produced and disposed of in the human body through normal metabolic processes. It is normally present in blood and urine. People with diabetic ketoacidosis produce it in larger amounts. Acetone is not regarded as a waste product of metabolism. However, its physiological role in biochemical machinery is not clear. A model for the role of acetone metabolism is presented that orders the events occurring in acetonemia in sequence: in diabetic ketosis or starvation, ketone body production (b-hydroxy-butyrate, acetoacetate) provides fuel for vital organs (heart, brain, among others) raising the chance of survival of the metabolic catastrophe. However, when ketone body production exceeds the degrading capacity, the accumulating acetoacetic acid presents a new challenge to the pH regulatory system. Acetone production and its further degradation to C3 fragments fulfill two purposes: the maintenance of pH buffering capacity and provision of fuel for peripheral tissues. Since ketosis develops under serious metabolic circumstances, all the mechanisms that balance or moderate the effects of ketosis enhance the chance for survival. From this point of view, the theory that transportable C3 fragments can serve as additional nutrients is a novel view of acetone metabolism which introduces a new approach to the study of acetone degradation, especially in understanding its physiological function and the interrelationship between liver and peripheral tissues. (PMID 10580530). Acetone is typically derived from acetoacetate through the action of microbial acetoacetate decarboxylases found in gut microflora. In chemistry, acetone is the simplest representative of the ketones. Acetone is a colorless, mobile, flammable liquid readily soluble in water, ethanol, ether, etc., and itself serves as an important solvent. It is an irritant and inhalation may lead to hepatotoxic effects (causing liver damage).

Carnitine is also classified as an alcohol (specifically, a trimethylated carboxy-alcohol). Carnitine exists as one of two stereoisomers (the two enantiomers D-carnitine and L-carnitine. Both are biologically active, but only L-carnitine naturally occurs in animals, and D-carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the L-form. Carnitine is involved in the metabolism in most mammals, plants, and some bacteria.  Carnitine plays a key role in lipid metabolism and beta-oxidation. It is used to transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria to be oxidized for energy production. This is done by forming a long chain acetylcarnitine esters which are then transported by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II. Carnitine also participates in removing products of metabolism from cells. Given its key metabolic roles, carnitine is concentrated in skeletal and cardiac muscle as well as other tissues that metabolize fatty acids as an energy source. A normal 70 kilogram person typically produces 11‚Äì34 mg of carnitine per day. Adults eating mixed diets of red meat and other animal products ingest 60‚Äì180 mg of carnitine per day, while vegans consume about 10‚Äì12 mg per day. Most carnitine obtained from the diet is absorbed in the small intestine before entering the blood.[3] The total body content of carnitine is about 20 grams in a person weighing 70 kilograms, with nearly all of it contained within skeletal muscle cells. Carnitine is so important in providing energy to muscles (including the heart) that some researchers are now recommending carnitine supplements in the diet, particularly for people who do not consume much red meat (the main food source for carnitine). Carnitine has been described as a vitamin, an amino acid, or a metabimin (i.e. an essential metabolite). Like the B vitamins, carnitine contains nitrogen and is very soluble in water. However, most animals, including humans, make their own carnitine; thus, carnitine cannot be considered to be a vitamin. In certain circumstances, such as methionine deficiency, lysine deficiency, vitamin C deficiency or kidney dialysis, carnitine shortages can develop. Under these conditions, carnitine must be absorbed from food, and for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as a \"metabimin\" or a conditionally essential metabolite. In humans, about 25% of carnitine is synthesized in the liver, kidney, and brain from lysine and methionine. Most of the carnitine in the body comes from dietary sources such as red meat and dairy products. Inborn errors of carnitine metabolism such as Reye‚Äôs syndrome can lead to brain deterioration gradually worsening muscle weakness, Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy, and extreme muscle weakness with fat accumulation in muscles. Carnitine is an essential nutrient for pre-term babies and individuals who are unable to eat a normal diet (e.g. non-ketotic hypoglycemics, kidney dialysis patients) (PMID: 115309). In conditions such as kwashiorkor, cirrhosis, and heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy) as well as in inborn errors of metabolism such as type IV hyperlipidemia and propionic aciduria, carnitine is essential to life and carnitine supplements are critically important. Carnitine therapy may also be useful in a wide variety of clinical conditions. Carnitine supplementation has improved some patients who have angina secondary to coronary artery disease. Carnitine supplements may also be useful in many forms of metabolic liver diseases and heart muscle disease. Hearts undergoing severe arrhythmia quickly deplete their stores of carnitine. Athletes, particularly in Europe, have used carnitine supplements for improved endurance. Carnitine may improve muscle building by improving fat utilization and may even be useful in treating obesity. Carnitine may be of value in treating pregnant women, hypothyroid individuals, and male infertility due to the low motility of sperm. Carnitine deficiency is noted in abnormal liver function, renal dialysis patients, and severe to moderate muscular weakness with associated anorexia. Carnitine is a biomarker for the consumption of meat. In fact, carnitine was first extracted from meat extracts in 1905, leading to its name from Latin, \"caro/carnis\" or flesh.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:NamedThing","biolink:DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature","biolink:Drug","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["CAR [extracellular region]","CAR [mitochondrial intermembrane space]","carnitinium","(R)-carnitinium","Levocarnitine (JAN/USP/INN)","LEVOCARNITINE PROPIONATE","levocarnitine","O-acetylcarnitine","Acetylcarnitine","ACETYLCARNITINE","Levocarnitine","Acetylcarnitine, (R)-Isomer","CARNITINE","L-Carnitine","DEXTROCARNITINE","Carnitine","(R)-carnitine","3-carboxy-2-hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethylpropan-1-aminium","LEVOCARNITINE PROPIONATE HYDROCHLORIDE","(3-Carboxy-2-(R)-Hydroxy-Propyl)-Trimethyl-Ammonium","CAR [cytosol]","CAR [peroxisomal matrix]","L-carnitine","Alcar","LEVOCARNITINE","ACAR [peroxisomal matrix]","levocarnitine propionate","L-Acetylcarnitine","CAR [mitochondrial matrix]","DL-Acetylcarnitine","O-Acetylcarnitine","O-acetyl-L-carnitine","carnitine","Medosan","Levocarnitine propionate hydrochloride (USAN)","acetylcarnitine","O-acetylcarnitinium"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PathWhiz.Compound:129","UMLS:C0007258","HMDB:HMDB0000201","KEGG.COMPOUND:C02571","VANDF:4029065","CHEBI:73024","LOINC:LP14482-1","REACT:R-ALL-201023","KEGG.DRUG:D04713","ATC:N06BX12","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1229656","CHEBI:57589","DrugCentral:64","NDDF:003576","UMLS:C0600146","PDQ:CDR0000301896","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1620698","MESH:D002331","REACT:R-ALL-390294","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00318","NCIT:C82599","NDDF:006988","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1149","KEGG.DRUG:D02176","UMLS:C0633601","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2107420","DRUGBANK:DB08842","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1358846","REACT:R-ALL-549207","CHEBI:17126","VANDF:4020870","UMLS:C0001040","HMDB:HMDB0000062","RXNORM:2106","RXNORM:42955","CHEBI:3424","REACT:R-ALL-30235","CHEBI:15960","REACT:R-ALL-390287","NCIT:C26657","NDDF:000932","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL172513","DrugCentral:4040","UMLS:C0087163","VANDF:4020953","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1516469","DRUGBANK:DB02648","DRUGBANK:DB00583","NCIT:C87329","CHEBI:39547","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00487","LOINC:LA16918-7","HMDB:HMDB0240773","DrugCentral:513","RXNORM:193","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1697733","VANDF:4018934","LOINC:MTHU001931","ATC:A16AA01","CHEBI:16347","MESH:D000108","PathWhiz.Compound:44","REACT:R-ALL-164988","UMLS:C0887516"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:15803480","PMID:8534410","PMID:30096165","PMID:10215651","PMID:10491992","PMID:15801863","PMID:22622056","PMID:10454528","PMID:19947605","PMID:3346778"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL170721":{"name":"METHYLGLYOXAL","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL170721","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL170721","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"APC is a metabolite of irinotecan.

Vitamin D3 is a steroid hormone that has long been known for its important role in regulating body levels of calcium and phosphorus, in mineralization of bone, and for the assimilation of Vitamin A. It is structurally similar to steroids such as testosterone, cholesterol, and cortisol (although vitamin D3, itself, is a secosteroid). Vitamin D3 is a derivative of 7-dehydroxycholesterol formed by ultraviolet rays breaking the C9-C10 bond. It differs from ergocalciferol in having a single bond between C22 and C23 and lacking a methyl group at C24. Vitamin D3 can also come from dietary sources, such as beef liver, cheese, egg yolks, and fatty fish (PubChem). The first step involved in the activation of vitamin D3 is a 25-hydroxylation catalyzed by 25-hydroxylase in the liver and then by other enzymes. The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyzes the first reaction in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates. The active form of vitamin D3 (calcitriol) binds to intracellular receptors that then function as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Like the receptors for other steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, the vitamin D receptor has hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains. The vitamin D receptor forms a complex with another intracellular receptor, the retinoid-X receptor, and that heterodimer is what binds to DNA. In most cases studied, the effect is to activate transcription, but situations are also known in which vitamin D suppresses transcription. Calcitriol increases the serum calcium concentrations by (1) increasing GI absorption of phosphorus and calcium, (2) increasing osteoclastic resorption, and (3) increasing distal renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through the formation of a calcium-binding protein.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Drug","biolink:BiologicalEntity"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["(R,Z)-3-((E)-2-((1R,3aS,7aR)-7a-methyl-1-((R)-6-methylheptan-2-yl)dihydro-1H-inden-4(2H,5H,6H,7H,7aH)-ylidene)ethylidene)-4-methylenecyclohexanol","SID29215240","cholecalciferol","vitamin D","colecalciferol","(S)-4-Methylene-3-{2-[(R)-7a-(R)-methyl-1-((R)-5-methyl-1-methyl-hexyl)-octahydro-inden-(4E)-ylidene]-ethylidene}-cyclohexanol","Cholecalciferol (JP18/USP)","CHOLECALCIFEROL","Cholecalciferols","Cholecalciferol","vitamin D3","calciol","Vitamin D3","VD3 [endoplasmic reticulum membrane]","VD3 [extracellular region]","Vitamin D","Vitamin d"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["RXNORM:1244014","PathWhiz.Compound:699","PDQ:CDR0000039734","UMLS:C0008318","PDQ:CDR0000467750","VANDF:4017667","RXNORM:11253","LOINC:MTHU008559","DRUGBANK:DB00169","ATC:A11CC05","LOINC:LP15456-4","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1042","DrugCentral:2840","NCIT:C48194","CHEBI:27300","MESH:D014807","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1949934","KEGG.DRUG:D00188","UMLS:C0242215","RXNORM:2418","UMLS:C3265062","VANDF:4021717","MESH:D002762","UMLS:C0042866","VANDF:4017649","KEGG.COMPOUND:C05443","LOINC:LP31696-5","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1365250","REACT:R-ALL-209767","LOINC:LA18888-0","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL432780","REACT:R-ALL-8963870","HMDB:HMDB0000876","CHEBI:28940"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:16886665","PMID:10676652","PMID:15149692","PMID:17629592","PMID:833826","PMID:24900716","PMID:22687748","PMID:28346348","PMID:184223","PMID:24885631"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2108989":{"name":"ASPARAGINASE","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL2108989","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL2108989","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"An enzyme isolated from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi (E. carotovora).

Pure forms of the element are colourless and transparent. This nonmetal is not soluble in water, but is soluble in carbon disulfide. The white allotrope ignites spontaneously in air; however, both white and red phosphorus burn in air to produce phosphorus pentoxide. Phosphorus is a key element in all known forms of life. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Inorganic phosphorus in the form of the phosphate PO43- plays a major role in biological molecules such as DNA and RNA where it forms part of the structural framework of these molecules. Living cells also utilize phosphate to transport cellular energy via adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Nearly every cellular process that uses energy gets it in the form of ATP. ATP is also important for phosphorylation, a key regulatory event in cells. Phospholipids are the main structural components of all cellular membranes. Calcium phosphate salts are used by animals to stiffen their bones. An average person contains a little less than 1 kg of phosphorus, about three quarters of which is present in bones and teeth in the form of apatite. A well-fed adult in the industrialized world consumes and excretes about 1-3 g of phosphorus per day in the form of phosphate. Phosphorus is an essential mineral macronutrient, which is studied extensively in soil conservation in order to understand plant uptake from soil systems. Due to its reactivity to air and many other oxygen containing substances, phosphorus is not found free in nature, but it is widely distributed in many different minerals. Phosphorus is found to be associated with glycerol intolerance syndrome, which is an inborn error of metabolism.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["phosphorus atom","PHOSPHINE","phosphorus(.)","phosphorus","phosphane","Phosphine","phosphine","Phosphorus"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL2227836","LOINC:LP34825-7","DRUGBANK:DB14151","HMDB:HMDB0001315","UMLS:C0031705","NDDF:000863","MESH:D010758","VANDF:4017689","PSY:38370","CHEBI:30207","RXNORM:8263","VANDF:4021890","NCIT:C47934","CHEBI:35883","MESH:C044646","PathWhiz.Compound:1014","KEGG.COMPOUND:C06262","CHEBI:28659","HMDB:HMDB0034790","LOINC:LP250916-6","CHEBI:30278","LOINC:MTHU017633","UMLS:C0070813","LOINC:MTHU014112"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:14765611","PMID:21360645","PMID:22807213","PMID:12944733","PMID:15243474","PMID:14637378","PMID:12699391","PMID:12942704","PMID:15251362","PMID:12753275"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL269732":{"name":"TACROLIMUS","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL269732","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"https://identifiers.org/chembl.compound:CHEMBL269732","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"A macrolide isolated from the fungus Streptomyces tsukubaensis.

Naringin belongs to the flavonoid family. Flavonoids consist of 15 carbon atoms in 3 rings, 2 of which must be benzene rings connected by a 3 carbon chain.  Naringin contains the basic flavonoid structure along with one rhamnose and one glucose unit attached to its aglycone portion, called naringenin, at the 7-carbon position. The steric hindrance provided by the two sugar units makes naringin less potent than its aglycone counterpart, naringenin. Naringin is a bitter tasting compound. Naringin is found, on average, in the highest concentration within a few different foods, such as rosemaries, grapefruit/pummelo hybrids, and grapefruits and in a lower concentration in grape wines, pummelo, and beers. Naringin has also been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as citrus, limes, herbs and spices, common oregano, and mandarin orange (clementine, tangerine). Both naringin and hesperetin, which are the aglycones of naringin and hesperidin, occur naturally in citrus fruits. Naringin is the major flavonoid glycoside in grapefruit and gives grapefruit juice its bitter taste.

Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Tolbutamide appears to be metabolized in the liver.

Aaron B.Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958. In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and. lowering the body temperature. Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood,learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant. Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders(ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits. were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:BiologicalEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["melatonin","MELATONIN","MLT [extracellular region]","Melatonin (JAN)","Melatonin","MLT [cytosol]","Circadin"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["MESH:D008550","DrugCentral:1672","KEGG.COMPOUND:C01598","DRUGBANK:DB01065","UMLS:C0025219","LOINC:MTHU002350","KEGG.DRUG:D08170","PathWhiz.Compound:1074","REACT:R-ALL-209934","CHEBI:16796","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL45","FMA:74644","NCIT:C2267","HMDB:HMDB0001389","REACT:R-ALL-419339","RXNORM:6711","PSY:30540","ATC:N05CH01","VANDF:4021324","UMLS:C1710381","LOINC:LP15036-4"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:27484514","PMID:12643943","PMID:30126274","PMID:14980664","PMID:21473625","PMID:10224140","PMID:12767050","PMID:7773197","PMID:8258829","PMID:15566297"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"FMA:82743":{"name":"Glucose","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_82743","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_82743","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"Gulose is an aldohexose sugar and a C-3 epimer of galactose.

(Gly), is an alpha-amino acid. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Glycine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Glycine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid and is the simplest of all amino acids. In humans, glycine is a nonessential amino acid, although experimental animals show reduced growth on low-glycine diets. The average adult human ingests 3 to 5 grams of glycine daily. Glycine is a colorless, sweet-tasting crystalline solid. It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid. Glycine was discovered in 1820 by the French chemist Henri Braconnot when he hydrolyzed gelatin by boiling it with sulfuric acid. The name comes from the Greek word glucus or \"sweet tasting\". Glycine is biosynthesized in the body from the amino acid serine, which is in turn derived from 3-phosphoglycerate. In the liver of vertebrates, glycine synthesis is catalyzed by glycine synthase (also called glycine cleavage enzyme). In addition to being synthesized from serine, glycine can also be derived from threonine, choline or hydroxyproline via inter-organ metabolism of the liver and kidneys. Glycine is degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals and plants is the reverse of the glycine synthase pathway. In this context, the enzyme system involved glycine metabolism is called the glycine cleavage system. The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF:plasma glycine ratio (PMID: 16151895). Glycine levels are effectively measured in plasma in both normal patients and those with inborn errors of glycine metabolism (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/). Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM: 606899) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10, and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T-, and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM: 238300), AMT (OMIM: 238310), and GCSH (OMIM: 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. Glycine is involved in the body's production of DNA, hemoglobin, and collagen, and in the release of energy. The principal function of glycine is as a precursor to proteins. Most proteins incorporate only small quantities of glycine, a notable exception being collagen, which contains about 35% glycine. In higher eukaryotes, delta-aminolevulinic acid, the key precursor to porphyrins (needed for hemoglobin and cytochromes), is biosynthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA by the enzyme ALA synthase. Glycine provides the central C2N subunit of all purines, which are key constituents of DNA and RNA. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, especially in the spinal cord, brainstem, and retina. When glycine receptors are activated, chloride enters the neuron via ionotropic receptors, causing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).","value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["biolink:NamedThing","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:Polypeptide","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:BiologicalEntity","biolink:OrganismTaxon","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["Gly [synaptic vesicle]","glycine zwitterion","Gly [extracellular region]","Gly [mitochondrial matrix]","Gly [cytosol]","Glycine (JP18/USP)","GLYCINE","Gly [mitochondrial intermembrane space]","Gly [peroxisomal matrix]","polyglycine","Glycine","glycine"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["REACT:R-ALL-428557","PDQ:CDR0000041347","KEGG.COMPOUND:C00037","LOINC:LP15620-5","DRUGBANK:DB00145","NCBITaxon:1462605","DrugCentral:1319","CHEBI:15428","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL773","PathWhiz.Compound:78","MESH:C011080","FMA:82753","PSY:21220","MESH:D005998","REACT:R-ALL-193446","NDDF:000929","RXNORM:4919","UMLS:C0071583","HMDB:HMDB0000123","NCBITaxon:3846","NCIT:C524","REACT:R-ALL-266029","CHEBI:57305","KEGG.DRUG:D00011","ATC:B05CX03","LOINC:MTHU003091","UMLS:C0017890","REACT:R-ALL-113545","REACT:R-ALL-159549","REACT:R-ALL-29424","VANDF:4017980"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2.","attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","original_attribute_name":null,"value":["PMID:22436388","PMID:20833035","PMID:10893301","PMID:16453318","PMID:22931300","PMID:9438018","PMID:24461352","PMID:10360746","PMID:30048132","PMID:12097436"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie","attribute_source":null,"value_url":null,"description":null,"attributes":null}]},"FMA:83350":{"name":"Glucagon","categories":["biolink:Drug"],"attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:IriType","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_83350","value_type_id":"metatype:Uri","attribute_source":null,"value_url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_83350","description":null,"attributes":null},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","original_attribute_name":null,"value":"The recombinant form of the endogenous polypeptide hormone Glucagon consisting of 29 amino acids responsible for the release of stored glucose, causing increased blood glucose levels.

Using antibiotics when you don't need them, or not using them properly, can add to antibiotic resistance. This happens when bacteria change and become able to resist the effects of an antibiotic. When you take antibiotics, follow the directions carefully. It is important to finish your medicine even if you feel better. If you stop treatment too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect you. Do not save antibiotics for later or use someone else's prescription.
