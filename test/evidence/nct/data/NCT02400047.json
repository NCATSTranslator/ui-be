  "BriefSummary":[
    "Postoperative pain and nausea-vomiting (PONV) are the first causes of failure in ambulatory care in pediatric surgery. Actually, the paracetamol/ketoprofen combination in intraoperative care is recommended for effective postoperative analgesia in children. However, intravenous ketoprofen doesn't have the marketing authorization for use in children less than 15 years old and its use is mainly justified by the absence of therapeutic alternatives. Recently, findings from published studies suggest that dexamethasone (DXM), which is actually recommended to prevent PONV for children \"at risk\", at a dose of 0.1mg/kg, would have analgesic properties above 0.15 mg/kg comparable to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAI).\n\nMain objective :\n\nTo examine the effects of intraoperative DXM (0.2mg/kg and 0.4mg/kg) on the intensity of postoperative pain in the post-anaesthetic care unit (PACU) compared to ketoprofen (1mg/kg).\n\nSecondary objectives :\n\nTo examine the effects of intraoperative DXM (0.2mg/kg and 0.4mg/kg) compared to ketoprofen (1mg/kg) on the anesthesia emergence delirium, the intensity of postoperative pain, the consumption of rescue analgesics and the side effects in the first 24 hours after surgery."
