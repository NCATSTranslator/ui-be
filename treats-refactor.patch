       "notes": "This predicate is helpful both as a grouping predicate to aid in searching for broader senses of treating a condition, and as a catch-all for representing sources that are not clear about the sense of treats that is being reported. For example, text-mined statements concerning treatments for disease are based on sentences that can report treatment in any of these different senses and thus require a broader predicate such as this to safely report statement semantics.",
